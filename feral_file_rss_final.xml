‚ÄúMetamultimouse‚Äù by Matthew Plummer-Fern√°ndez.  Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce Doppelganger, an exhibition featuring works by Matthew Plummer-Fern√°ndez, Jeremy Bailey, Rodell Warner, Sophie Kahn, Rujunko Pugh (Syberweerd), Laleh Mehran, and LaTurbo Avedon.&lt;br/&gt;
Collectors of these editions will  be eligible to receive a ‚Äúdoppelganger,‚Äù in the form of a 3D printed counterpart of the work from Shapeways. Feral File will contact collectors within two weeks of the auction closing for fulfillment. Shipping and printing costs are included in the price of the work. Note that all orders will take&lt;br/&gt;
6-8 weeks&lt;br/&gt;
to deliver.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Chris Coleman on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe works in Doppelganger explore identities that cross and fuse boundaries. Each of the artists are exploring how they define the self, especially in connection with technological change. Each of the works will exist in digital and physical forms, the same and yet also very different because of the materiality or lack thereof. Perhaps each format will bring collectors a different understanding of the ideas, empowered by touch instead of channeling through a cursor. Hopefully balance and reconciliation can be found between the physical and digital, letting us celebrate both and also consider what control means in the rapids of our swift life streams.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúRelic Viewports‚Äù by LaTurbo Avedon. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Relic Viewports&lt;br/&gt;
As avatar artist LaTurbo Avedon continues to expand the simulated world of the Materia System, here it is visualized through a series of Viewports. These objects operate as windows and mirrors of immaterial space, rendering perspectives of the Materia System through their specific forms. Materia is a mythos emerging from the long term interactions and connections with LaTurbo in their worlds.  For this exhibition, Avedon has created the work ‚ÄúRelic Viewports,‚Äù which is tethered to a limited series of physical objects, offered as tangible records of the System‚Äôs early development.&lt;br/&gt;
Metamultimouse (Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Matthew Plummer-Fern√°ndez‚Äôs ‚ÄúMetamultimouse‚Äù is a digital and physical figurine that is both one and many at the same time, embodying the paradox of distributed ownership for hybrid digital-physical artworks. In digital form, the work exists as an animation made with CGI and AI software, morphing between various computer-generated patinas. In physical form, each copy manifests as one of its possible versions. ‚ÄúMetamultimouse‚Äù continues the artist‚Äôs inquiry into changing attitudes towards copyright, especially in relation to 3D printing, often using derivatives of Mickey Mouse to exacerbate copyright conundrums. In this latest installment, a smoothed-out version of Mickey rendered free from copyright now has to grapple with NFT culture, where popular characters are expected to be both unique and discernibly similar, often using code to create variants and randomize their distribution.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFFF (Famous Fractional Face)‚Äú by Jeremy Bailey. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
FFF (Famous Fractional Face)&lt;br/&gt;
The acronym PFP refers to ‚Äúpicture for proof‚Äù or ‚Äúprofile picture.‚Äù PFP NFTs emerged as a ubiquitous format from projects like CryptoPunks where thousands of digital avatars are randomly generated as unique 1/1 NFTs. Famous New Media Artist Jeremy Bailey is a living digital avatar, but unlike PFPs, his identity is fixed and unique. How might we all benefit from this emerging asset class that relies on variation without diluting Bailey‚Äôs famously consistent identity? The solution is simple: by dividing himself into 100 unique slices or ‚Äòcoins,‚Äô many more collectors can own a unique share of his total self. Each coin will be available as a real physical coin referencing a cross section of Famous New Media Artist Jeremy Bailey‚Äôs head. Every collector will also get access to a digital augmented reality (AR) model of his complete head for their reference and enjoyment.&lt;br/&gt;

In the words of Casey Reas: ‚ÄúEach of the six artists in +GRAPH created generative software that is capable of making limitless new drawings, and has transformed 30 of these variations into physical works using a plotter machine. Every plotter drawing in this exhibition is a 1/1 artwork, meaning only one will ever be created. Along with each of these unique drawings, there are millions of other compositions that are embedded in the original code.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Christiane Paul on Chain Reaction:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúChain Reaction strives to underscore the inherent connections between the blockchain as a list of data blocks facilitating the recording of transactions and tracking of assets, and the generative social, aesthetic, and environmental contexts and networks in which these assets are embedded. The works in this exhibition explore their existence as ‚Äòtokens‚Äô beyond just being technological records of a transaction: they function as catalysts in precipitating events or actions, from environmental preservation and sustainability of a creative process to aesthetic choices. NFTs are functionally defined by their non-fungible status. They are capable of encapsulating and proving ownership of digital artworks that are often characterized by malleable, generative, untraceable, or imperceptible qualities. The artworks in Chain Reaction highlight the porous boundaries between NFTs as a mechanism for unique identification, on the one hand, and as a common ‚Äòkeepsake‚Äô of a social contract and commitment, or collective action, on the other.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Selected Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Public View / Private View by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy&lt;br/&gt;
Jennifer and Kevin McCoy‚Äôs ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù opens up the artistic process of creation ‚Äî usually driven by artists‚Äô concepts and aesthetic choices ‚Äî to a community of donors and art supporters connected to the McCoys. Collectors receive an animated composite of a series of images that are based on pictures submitted to the McCoys by a group of donors of the artists‚Äô work who thereby participated in the NFT‚Äôs creation process. ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù is based on the McCoys‚Äô 2018 project ‚ÄúPublic Key / Private Key‚Äù for which they produced a short 16mm film, donated it to the Whitney Museum‚Äôs Special Collection, then issued 50 Ethereum ERC-721 tokens to represent the right to be named as one of the ‚Äúdonors of record‚Äù for the film and selected 50 donors from an open call for applications. The tokens were allowed to freely circulate for a period of six months. For ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View,‚Äù the McCoys asked these 50 donors of record to submit an image personally meaningful to them and created a coded interpretation of it. The interpretations of the donors‚Äô 50 images were then combined into the animation that collectors can purchase as NFT. The 50 donors receive an ink-on-paper version of the image. While ‚ÄúPublic Key / Private Key‚Äù made the donation process accessible to a wider public, ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù involves the donors in the creation process itself. Using the blockchain as authentication and distribution mechanism, the two projects form a creative chain that not only binds the artists as makers to an expanding community of interested supporters, but makes the nodes along the way a formal part of the work itself. In ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù the blockchain anchors the creation, distribution, and archiving process of the artwork.&lt;br/&gt;
Seed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124 by Amelia Winger-Bearskin (Image Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Amelia Winger-Bearskin‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124‚Äù involves collectors in her ongoing artwork inspired by seeds and their caretakers. The NFT edition consists of an image of an identical pile of corn seeds that have been colored by the artist in 100 variations, wrapping the seeds in hand-drawn patterns. As still life, the seed piles imagine what the future seven generations of corn seeds might look like, suggesting textile and beading patterns or more alien mutations. Corn is one of the ‚Äúthree sisters‚Äù (corn, beans, and squash) according to the knowledge of the Haudenausaunee people. (Winger-Bearskin is an enrolled member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma, which is part of the Haudenosaunee confederacy.) The three sisters are grown together, giving nutrients, shade, and support. The ‚Äúseven generations‚Äù concept reminds us that our current knowledge is built on that of the seven generations before us, and that we must make good decisions for our descendants seven generations in the future.&lt;br/&gt;
Each of the seed pile variations has a unique DLITE (Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time) number, riffing on the Terrestrial Dynamical Time that NASA uses as a timestamp for celestial voyages.¬†The future that Winger-Bearskin imagines for seeds is inspired in equal parts by several sources: the celestial storytelling of the Seneca-Cayuga; NASA‚Äôs Project Artemis; as well as the work of her colleagues‚Äô Robert Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul, plant molecular biologists who lead a team focused on growing plants in space at the University of Florida Space Plant Lab.&lt;br/&gt;
Along with the NFT, collectors receive a participation contract and access to the Seed Protocol website, asking¬† them to contribute to the larger seed protocol project. They will receive regular updates on all online and in-person events related to Seed Protocol project 2023-2024. Collectors will also play an active role in shaping the project by agreeing to make contributions: engaging with a local seed bank or heirloom seed society in their area and uploading information about the organization to Amelia Winger-Bearskin‚Äôs Seed Bank Directory or engaging with one of the seed groups with whom the artist is working.&lt;br/&gt;

The Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater by Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow&lt;br/&gt;
Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater‚Äù allows collectors to purchase an oyster, a unique NFT in the digital ocean. While the outsides of the oyster shells are similar, each of the 100 oysters in the edition is unique. The insides are structured through custom generative software according to four categories, each based on an aspect of oyster physiology, purpose, and lore: Oyster Engineer (plumbing, cleaning, sifting, filtering machinery); Oyster Artist (creating beauty, wonder, inspiration, well-being); Oyster Sex Symbol (aphrodisiacal and sex-changing); and Oyster Kin (with other animals, including humans who ‚Äúfarm‚Äù and eat them). The artists used AI to generate the oyster elements and backgrounds; embedded across the four categories are fifteen unique surprises, with varying degrees of rarity.&lt;br/&gt;
Along with their oyster, collectors receive a unique password that gives them access to the OysterCraftReef website, where they see their NFT come together with the other collected oysters to form a visual reef. As a collective structure, the oyster reef supports real-world projects such as oyster reef cultivation, conservation, and awareness work. After no more than 90 days after the birth of the reef, collectors will vote on distributing the funds generated through their purchase to three different groups supporting oyster reef conservation, which has been identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a priority. The project title, ‚ÄúThe Dorises,‚Äù alludes to Doris, a sea goddess in Greek mythology. Doris was one of the 3000 Oceanids, daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and represents the fertility of the ocean. Her name connects the two words¬†D√¥ron, meaning ‚Äúgift‚Äù or ‚Äúabundance,‚Äù and¬†Z√¥ros, meaning the ‚Äúpure‚Äù and ‚Äúunmixed,‚Äù often used to describe fresh water.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúOur Feral File offering ‚Äî the first exhibition of verse on this platform ‚Äî is planted here as a seed for the poetry journal of the future, in which authorial imagination is unbounded, language and art exist in symbiosis, and every contributor is a vital force in a literary ecosystem in which connection to verse can lead to collection.&lt;br/&gt;
In celebration of both National Poetry Month and Earth Month, the texts published here as non-fungible Tezos tokens ‚Äì each a collaborative performance between writers and artists at the avant-garde of web3 poetry, including some of the planet‚Äôs most renowned voices ‚Äì reflect diverse perspectives, aesthetics, and approaches to the worlds around us and inside us, always in flux. Every work invites its reader to step into a reality augmented through the art of poetry, and to engage deeply with the untamed universe of possibilities for writers on (and off) the blockchain.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About theVERSEverse:&lt;br/&gt;
Launched in November 2021, theVERSEverse is a collective of critically acclaimed poets, writers, artists, and creative technologists working on and off the blockchain to unlock the literary potential of web3. Through hybrid events, community outreach, and partnerships, theVERSEverse is creating new opportunities for writers and reshaping the future of literature.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Selected Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSpring So Uneasy‚Äù by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram x Dina Chang. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Spring So Uneasy by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram x Dina Chang&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSpring So Uneasy‚Äù is a collaboration between poet Lillian-Yvonne Bertram and artist Dina Chang, in which Chang‚Äôs visuals provide a stunning photographic take on Bertram‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúThe Body Deformed by Tidal Forces.‚Äù The poem is a muscular lyrical meditation on the physics of tidal forces that simultaneously create solidity and changes of season through rotation and gravitational push/pull and threaten destruction when the same forces of these rotating celestial bodies are brought into too close a contact to sustain their individual integrities. The same phenomenon, Bertram suggests, literally and figuratively applies to earth-bound human bodies and the ways people too are bound to an ungodly planet spinning ferociously through the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù by Seth Bockley x Helena Sarin. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù by Seth Bockley x Helena Sarin&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù is part of Seth Bockley‚Äôs Nature Speaks! series. This initiative, created through the poet‚Äôs position as director of creative engagement for Sovereign Nature Initiative, a web3 tech/theory/art collective, imagines giving human voice to nonhuman experiences, while recognizing the impossibility of fully translating those experiences. Helena Sarin‚Äôs visual rendering pays homage to the hackberry seed itself, the wood of the tree, its germination, pulsating, becoming, and the smile and energy with which the poet delivers the poem.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFuturum Febris‚Äù by Denise Duhamel x Diane Drubay. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Futurum Febris by Denise Duhamel x Diane Drubay&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFuturum Febris,‚Äù fruit of the collaboration between the poet Denise Duhamel and visual artist Diane Drubay, takes us on a journey towards a distressing transcendence. The planet becomes a metaphor for the memories and thoughts of the narrator of ‚ÄúPilgrims,‚Äù Duhamel‚Äôs poem. Like a path that accompanies the text, going from the naivety of youth to the realization of a conflicting system, the exploration of the two planets invites us to travel towards a feverish future.&lt;br/&gt;
The visual piece is composed of an excerpt from Duhamel‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúPilgrims,‚Äù encircling the planets like a blue guiding thread. The two rotating 3D objects are covered with photographs of interference colors captured in the sky. One is calming and peaceful, creating a meditative state and a moment of harmony. The second is heated and alarming, causing a sense of fascination and panic at the same time. Drubay uses psycho-active colors and the feeling of total isolation to heighten the senses and embrace new ideas and perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;
This work plays with a descriptive narrative that takes the viewer/reader into a scene of changing emotions and states, calling for transformation by creating true impact.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Anika Meier on LEEMULLICAN.PCX:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAs a pioneer of computer art, Lee Mullican has devoted his life to finding new ways to create images. He embraced new technologies and tools of the day. In the fall of¬†1986, Lee Mullican participated in UCLA‚Äôs Advanced Design Research Center‚Äôs Program for Technology in the Arts. The program allowed the then¬†66-year-old Mullican to start exploring the digital realm.&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition LeeMullican.PCX presents 12 NFTs that demonstrate the artist‚Äôs relentless experimentation. Mullican is an institutionally recognized painter, he is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. He skillfully used his knowledge of painterly techniques as a guide when he began working with computers and found common ground with his own style of painting and the chance made possible by the computer.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Lee Mullican:&lt;br/&gt;
Lee Mullican was born in 1919 in Chickasha, Oklahoma and died in Los Angeles in 1998. Upon his graduation from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1942, Mullican was drafted into the army, serving four years as a topographical draftsman before moving to San Francisco in 1946.&lt;br/&gt;
After winning a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959, he spent a year painting in Rome before returning to Los Angeles where he joined the UCLA Art Department in 1961, keeping his position for nearly 30 years. He divided the later part of his life between his homes in Los Angeles and Taos, traveling internationally and co-organizing exhibitions at UCLA. A retrospective spanning 50 years of the artist‚Äôs work was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;
Mullican is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.&lt;br/&gt;

About the show:&lt;br/&gt;
Material Wonderland includes eight new NFT works minted on Ethereum, which will be available to purchase through Feral File. Also shown at Vellum LA will be works available as non-NFT digital files: two full-length video works exploring the game world as well as a massive video triptych of ‚ÄúMaterial World Knight,‚Äù presenting genome-edited human beings, human-machine composites with powered exoskeleton, and robots on an immersive 600 sq ft panoramic LED wall for Vellum LA‚Äôs opening reception.&lt;br/&gt;
The NFT works in the series are video loops rendered from within Lu Yang‚Äôs 2019 computer game, ‚ÄúThe Great Adventure of Material World,‚Äù first shown at the 2018 Shanghai Biennale. The game is initially experienced as a standard Japanese anime role-playing computer game, where players embody the Material World Knight as they complete quests and battle enemies together with other characters drawn from the artist‚Äôs earlier works, while growing in power and abilities. However, over the course of ten stages players undergo multiple identity transformations as they move beyond tropes of popular manga culture to explore the control of identity liberated from the rigid confines of nationality, gender, and sexuality.&lt;br/&gt;
Material Wonderland is set in dialogue with the LACMA‚Äôs Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age, 1952‚Äì1982, open from February 12th, which explores how the rise of computer technology, together with its emergence in popular consciousness, impacted the making of art in the age of the mainframe.&lt;br/&gt;
About Lu Yang&lt;br/&gt;
Lu Yang (b.1984 China, based in Tokyo, Japan) creates fantastical, often painful and shocking images which represent a blend of religion, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology and modern technology, as well as references to real life forms and structures of natural and religious origin. Lu Yang‚Äôs output spans gaming engines, 3D-animated films, video game installations, holograms, motion capture performances, virtual reality and software manipulation. The artist also collaborates with acclaimed scientists, psychologists, performers, designers, experimental composers, music producers, robotics companies and pop stars.&lt;br/&gt;
Yang‚Äôs work has been shown in major exhibitions at the UCCA, Centre Pompidou, ICA London, Mus√©e d‚Äôart Contemporain Lyon, Momentum Berlin, MAXXI National Museum of XXI Arts, and the Asia Society NY Art Triennial. He has also participated in numerous Biennales such as: Shanghai Biennale, (2018 and 2012), Athens Biennale (2018), Liverpool Biennial (2016), Montreal International Digital Art Biennial (2016), and Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2014). Lu Yang was selected for the Chinese Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale and has featured new work in The Milk of Dreams exhibition at the 2022 Venice Biennale.&lt;br/&gt;

About the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition therefore celebrates both the continued relevance of the historical ‚Äúpeers‚Äù and the contributions of the new ‚Äúpeers‚Äù to art‚Äôs expanding network of ideas.&lt;br/&gt;
From its founding in 1862, the Buffalo AKG has been committed to defining artistic movements as they emerge, including those born from dialogues with technologies such as photography and video.&lt;br/&gt;
Peer to Peer&lt;br/&gt;
continues this legacy into the present, while reconsidering the role of museums in a decentralized art world. As digital technologies increasingly influence every aspect of our lives, museums have an opportunity ‚Äî and responsibility ‚Äî to amplify the voices of artists who are creatively and critically exploring the aesthetic potentials and social consequences of these powerful new tools.&lt;br/&gt;
Peer to Peer&lt;br/&gt;
presents 13 new works produced with a variety of technologies, from Artificial Intelligence to 3D modeling, and ranging in format from videos and GIFs to PDFs, websites, software applications, and smart contracts. While technologically experimental, the works also speak to ‚Äî and transform ‚Äî themes explored by artists over the last two centuries, including the relationship between abstraction and figuration, the creativity of the unconscious mind, and the definition of art as a conceptual system.&lt;br/&gt;
We look forward to seeing you at the opening on Feral File and in Miami.&lt;br/&gt;

Announcing Two Major Exhibitions Celebrating Two Years of Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File is pleased to announce two exhibitions that get at the heart of Feral File‚Äôs work over the last two years:&lt;br/&gt;
The Experiment&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File 1.0&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
To celebrate the launch of Feral File 2.0 ‚Äî which comprises a refreshed look, a rework of our exhibition program, and a new way to collect works ‚Äî these two exhibitions pay homage to the ‚Äúexperiment‚Äù that started it all, and the amazing roster of artists we‚Äôve had the privilege of collaborating with thus far.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition opening:&lt;br/&gt;
June 28, 2023&lt;br/&gt;
14:00 UTC+0&lt;br/&gt;
(7am Los Angeles, 11am S√£o Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;
More about The Experiment&lt;br/&gt;
In 2019, Casey REAS, Rick Silva, Addie Wagenknecht, and artist duo exonemo (SEMBO Kensuke and AKAIWA Yae) invited a group of artists to bring one editioned artwork to swap with each other over the course of a week. The experiment was called a2p, short for artist-to-peer network, and it became the basis for the structure and ethos of Feral File. Now, over two years since Feral File launched, The Experiment brings a2p back into focus, with Feral File‚Äôs first non-collectable exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;
The Experiment features works from:&lt;br/&gt;
Alan Butler, Andrew Benson, Auriea Harvey XLVIII, √âmilie Brout &amp;amp; Maxime Marion, hiroyuki nisougi, Kim Asendorf, LaTurbo Avedon, Lee Blalock (L[3]^2), LIA, Morehshin Allahyari, Nicolas Sassoon, peter burr, Sabrina Ratt√©, Sara Ludy, Sarah Rara, shawn√© michaelain holloway, Tabor Robak, Theo Triantafyllidis, and Yoshi Sodeoka&lt;br/&gt;

Dmitri Cherniak, Claudia Hart, Andrew Thomas Huang, Cao Shu, Lauren Lee McCarthy, ertdfgcvb, Helena Sarin, Jan St. Werner, Refik Anadol, Tyler Hobbs, Morehshin Allahyari, Sofia Crespo, Sage Jensen, Rafa√´l Rozendaal, Whistlegraph, 0xDEAFBEEF, VNS Matrix, p1xelfool, Laleh Mehran, Gene Kogan, Zach Blas, John Gerrard, Auriea Harvey XLVIII, LaTurbo Avedon, AES+F, Peter Burr, Lu Yang, Amelia Winger-Bearskin, Lee Mullican, Ana Maria Caballero √ó Nancy Baker Cahill, Rick Silva, Kim Asendorf, and Serwah Attafuah&lt;br/&gt;

Autonomous and Alive: Kim Asendorf on his new work COLORS OF NOISE&lt;br/&gt;
Still from ‚ÄúCOLORS OF NOISE‚Äù by Kim Asendorf&lt;br/&gt;
Visit exhibition&lt;br/&gt;
The German visual artist speaks with curator Peggy Schoenegge about shades of noise, the role of the algorithm, and working with sound.&lt;br/&gt;
Read the full conversation on&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúI‚Äôm very much fascinated by the power of noise‚Ä¶ In audio engineering, you can actually split up the full spectrum of noise ‚Äî which is called white noise ‚Äî into various shades, which are named by colors, such as pink noise, brown noise, and white noise.&lt;br/&gt;
With this work, I use these different shades of acoustic noise to drive a visual animation.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äî Kim Asendorf&lt;br/&gt;
Still from ‚ÄúCOLORS OF NOISE‚Äù by Kim Asendorf&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúWhat I&amp;#x27;m really doing is having algorithms generate the noise acoustically, and I use the wave form of it ‚Äî the wave shape, which is basically showing the current value of the audio ‚Äî which is displayed in the center of the screen, triggering some kind of reaction around it.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[all&lt;br/&gt;
https://feralfile.com&lt;br/&gt;
Welcome to the first Feral File newsletter! To keep our community in the loop with all things Feral File, we‚Äôll be sending out a newsletter every two weeks. We‚Äôll share news about upcoming exhibitions, plus behind-the-scenes updates as we continue developing the platform.&lt;br/&gt;
Our next exhibition will open on&lt;br/&gt;
September 9, 2021, at 14:00 UTC+0 (10pm Shanghai, 3pm London, 10am New York, 7am Los Angeles).&lt;br/&gt;
As usual, collecting will begin one hour later.&lt;br/&gt;
Learn more&lt;br/&gt;
through our press release and&lt;br/&gt;
join us on Discord&lt;br/&gt;
to engage with other collectors, the artists, and curator Pau Waelder.&lt;br/&gt;
Instructions Follow&lt;br/&gt;
Announcing a new exhibition of digital artwork reflecting on the codes, regulations, and defaults that govern our present time, curated by Pau Waelder. The show will feature video, web-based, interactive, generative, and conceptual artworks by a group of twelve international artists and artist groups. Encompassing a variety of formats, each work will be made available to collectors as editioned NFTs.&lt;br/&gt;

Site Updates: Support for Ethereum &amp;amp; Account 2FA&lt;br/&gt;
Last week, we held a community discussion on&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
about our bridge to help users bring their Feral File NFTs to Ethereum. We are planning to launch this at the end of the month. You can&lt;br/&gt;
read more about the technical details on our HackMD&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
We‚Äôve enabled optional two-factor authentication (2FA) on the site. 2FA/MFA secures your account by having you submit a code generated by an authenticator app (like&lt;br/&gt;
Google Authenticator&lt;br/&gt;
or&lt;br/&gt;
Authy&lt;br/&gt;
) in order to transfer funds outside of Feral File or sell and transfer an edition. Without 2FA, if someone were to gain access to the email account you connected to Feral File, they could place your collection on sale or transfer your funds to their own account. But with 2FA, your account is much more secure. Find it in your account settings.&lt;br/&gt;
In our last exhibition, collectors paying with crypto had an advantage over those who used credit cards: crypto collectors could complete the transaction faster and beat a credit card collector in making a purchase. This is no longer the case - as long as you complete a transaction in the time provided, your purchase window is exclusive to you.&lt;br/&gt;
Coming soon: Autonomy, a mobile-first NFT viewing experience&lt;br/&gt;
We have big plans to launch a universal NFT experience for mobile phones called Autonomy. To give you a sense of what we‚Äôre building, you can look forward to a seamless, customizable new way to enjoy your Feral File collection securely on your phone. Just like you wouldn‚Äôt display a piece of art in your home without thinking about how to frame and light it, you should have options for how to view and enjoy your NFT collection everywhere you go‚Äîand we‚Äôre excited to share our solution with you soon.&lt;br/&gt;
The first version of Autonomy will be released by early October, first for iPhone and then for Android in Q4.&lt;br/&gt;
Connect with Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
If you‚Äôd like to be among the first to access Autonomy and give feedback, please join the Autonomy channel on our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
. There‚Äôs so much more that we‚Äôre planning to roll out by the end of the year, and we‚Äôll be sharing peeks of what‚Äôs to come with our community‚Äîso don‚Äôt miss out.&lt;br/&gt;
With all our changes, feel free to send us feedback on how they‚Äôre working for you and how we can do better. In addition to Discord, we‚Äôre also on&lt;br/&gt;
Instagram&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Casey Reas on P1√ó3L&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúA P1√ó3L is the atomic unit of digital and generative art. It can‚Äôt be quantified. A P1√ó3L is vibrant and alive. Artists choreograph P1√ó3Ls and P1√ó3Ls possess artists. P1√ó3Ls are ideas about image-making that transcend the technology they flow through‚Ä¶. This remarkable group of artists has each pushed the boundaries of the fields of digital and generative art in their own ways. As a counterpoint to the stream of technology being developed to make itself invisible, these artists foreground the materiality of their medium.&lt;br/&gt;
Online spaces for digital and generative art are at the highest energy I‚Äôve seen in over two decades, and things have shifted even since we started organizing this exhibition in June. I‚Äôm thrilled to present this new work from a  group of artists who committed to digital and generative art over a decade ago and remain vibrant creators. Their past work has stood the tests of time and their current work pushes forward.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Site Updates: Autonomy on Testflight, Ethereum compatibility&lt;br/&gt;
In our last newsletter, I mentioned our work on Autonomy, a mobile-first NFT viewing experience. At first, it will let you enjoy your Feral File collection everywhere you go, but we‚Äôll quickly add NFT support for other blockchains including Ethereum. We‚Äôre currently looking for feedback on&lt;br/&gt;
our TestFlight release&lt;br/&gt;
(iPhone only) - leave us feedback through our autonomy-app channel on&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
We are finishing up development of our ERC721 bridge. We expect collectors to be able to move their editions from the Bitmark chain into the Ethereum chain by the end of October. Feedback from the community was helpful in fine tuning our metadata to make it easy to search for Feral File artworks in Opensea. For anyone interested in the technical details,&lt;br/&gt;

Autonomy is now ready for all iPhone users (Android coming this year). It‚Äôs the home for all your NFT art and other collectibles ‚Äî a seamless, customizable way to enjoy your collection. Its beautiful user interface is coupled with a decentralized key management system we initially built to help people protect their Bitcoin.&lt;br/&gt;
Download it now on&lt;br/&gt;
Apple‚Äôs App Store.&lt;br/&gt;
You would never display a piece of art in your home without thinking about how to frame and light it. Autonomy finally gives you options for how to view and enjoy your NFT collection everywhere you go.&lt;br/&gt;
Last month we released an early preview of Autonomy with support for Feral File NFTs. In this alpha release, we‚Äôve added support for Ethereum NFTs (ERC-721) and WalletConnect. In Q4, we will be adding more blockchains like Tezos (Hic et Nunc), in moving towards universal NFT support and functionality such as seed import.&lt;br/&gt;
We‚Äôd love to hear what you think and we could really use your feedback on the new ERC-721 support.&lt;br/&gt;
You can leave us feedback through our autonomy-app channel on&lt;br/&gt;
Discord.&lt;br/&gt;
Announcing our Open Call for Curators&lt;br/&gt;
We started building Feral File in June 2020, opening the first exhibition in March 2021. Since then, we‚Äôve increased the options for what forms Feral File exhibitions can take, and now have a modular set of pieces that can be put together by artists and curators in different ways.&lt;br/&gt;
We are pleased to invite you to become part of our next wave of curators with our open call for proposals.&lt;br/&gt;
Learn more about our submissions process here.&lt;br/&gt;
Jan St. Werner‚Äôs Polyarrythmia&lt;br/&gt;
Our next exhibition, Polyarrythmia, will open on October 26, 2021 14:00 UTC+0 (10pm Shanghai, 4pm Berlin, 11pm S√£o Paulo, 7am Los Angeles), and  collecting will begin one hour later. With this solo exhibition of electronic musician Jan St. Werner, the idea is to put audio at the forefront, positioning it at the same level as visual work within the framework of digital art.&lt;br/&gt;
Join us on Discord&lt;br/&gt;
to engage with other collectors and St. Werner.&lt;br/&gt;
Each audio work will be released as an edition of 90, with each priced at 110 USDC. Additionally, the complete set will be released as an edition of 60; with each priced at 990 USDC.&lt;br/&gt;
Jan St. Werner on Polyarrythmia:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPolyarrythmia is an album or an exhibition or a selection of pieces, or maybe just a narrative in sound. None of the compositions have a strict metronome; there is no click or clock. The album as a whole has these interlocking peaks, micro-moments and movements, and then larger arcs, which meet and then disperse. To me that is very much what rhythm is, thus the name Polyarrythmia.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe compositions were mastered to be as present and intense as possible. The actual files that people download when they collect will provide the maximum resolution that people will be able to play back. I‚Äôm happy for listeners to experience the compositions separately, but to me, Polyarrythmia is a set, it‚Äôs a narrative as a whole. The pieces were all constructed in relation to each other, based on a visionary brain space, let‚Äôs call it. I was thinking, how far can I let these things drift off? How much space can I give it to unfold and go its own way? When I draw it back, that‚Äôs what becomes an individual composition or a piece.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Our first solo exhibition, Jan St. Werner‚Äôs Polyarrythima.&lt;br/&gt;
Request: Help us Improve our Upcoming Auction Experiences&lt;br/&gt;
By the end of the year, Feral File will launch highest bidder and group auctions in support of our artists. I‚Äôll be discussing the details around these auctions and why we‚Äôve decided to implement them as we get closer to launch.&lt;br/&gt;
For now, our product team would love to have you test out the user interface to make sure we‚Äôre making the bidding process as smooth as possible.&lt;br/&gt;
You can join the tests through our #features channel the Platform section of our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord.&lt;br/&gt;

Each of the artists in ‚ÄìGRAPH has created one software artwork that creates 30 unique physical drawings. Twelve sets (bundles of all six works) will be made available to collectors, as well as 11 of the editions from each artist. The pieces will be auctioned to the highest bidders, and the first collector of each edition will receive the corresponding plotter drawing shipped directly from the artist‚Äôs studio. Each software NFT includes millions of other compositions that are embedded in the software that can be viewed through an interface created by each artist.&lt;br/&gt;
See our&lt;br/&gt;
press release&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Casey Reas on ‚ÄìGRAPH:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúWhen I made my first plotter drawings, I can say without exaggeration that it completely transformed my understanding of the history of computer-generated drawings. Before, I had vaguely understood how they were created, but now I felt their production in detail... Each drawing is truly unique and is often the result of careful physical adjustments and extreme patience.&lt;br/&gt;
Making plotter drawings is difficult and wonderful, and the artists in ‚ÄìGRAPH are passionate about this medium. These artists all share a love of working with visual systems and writing code, and transforming how the code is rendered through drawing machines.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Additions to the Ethereum Bridge&lt;br/&gt;
We have been making steady progress with our Ethereum bridge. We have just added support for Refik Anadol‚Äôs Unsupervised and in total can handle migrations for:&lt;br/&gt;
#009 - Unsupervised (&lt;br/&gt;
See the OpenSea Collection&lt;br/&gt;
)&lt;br/&gt;
#008 - Polyarrythmia&lt;br/&gt;
#007 - Reflections in the Water&lt;br/&gt;
#006 - P1√ó3L&lt;br/&gt;
We will finish supporting the remaining five shows before the end of the year.&lt;br/&gt;
As a reminder, you can access the bridge for supported artworks when you view your edition within your collection. We have also received great feedback about how to improve our presence on OpenSea - you will see these optimizations rolled out over the next week.&lt;br/&gt;
You can help us further by sharing feedback and participating in user tests through our #features, #feedback, and #troubleshooting channels in the Platform section of our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Physical Rewards for Refik Anadol‚Äôs Unsupervised&lt;br/&gt;
Collectors who are holding three artworks (within one account) from the ‚ÄúDreams‚Äù series (9 artworks x 100 editions) as of December 1, 2021 will receive archival prints of their images shipped from the artist‚Äôs studio in early 2022. The prints will be 22&amp;quot; high and 12.4&amp;quot; wide.&lt;br/&gt;
This requirement can be met by purchasing editions from secondary marketplaces. On Feral File, you can view editions for sale from other collectors by viewing the artwork you prefer, and click &amp;quot;Collect&amp;quot;.&lt;br/&gt;
Collectors who won the 1/1 auctions will receive physical editions of their NFTs.&lt;br/&gt;
While Refik Anadol is finalizing the logistics, receive the latest updates&lt;br/&gt;
in his community on Discord.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File on Sustainability&lt;br/&gt;
Since we launched earlier this year, we have received many questions about our mission to build a sustainable curated ecosystem for digital art. As an overview, we focus on sustainability in the following areas:&lt;br/&gt;
Economic ‚Äî by creating sustainable relationships between artists and collectors, through evolution of the classic 1971 legal agreement ‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
The Artist‚Äôs Reserved Rights Transfer and Sale Agreement.&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Environmental ‚Äî by offsetting 125% of our estimated carbon impact and supporting additional measures, with the goal of being a net-positive contributor to the planet‚Äôs environment.&lt;br/&gt;
Technological ‚Äî by supporting open infrastructure in the same ways that facilitated the creation of TCP/IP and the Web.&lt;br/&gt;
You can learn more on our new&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Domenico Quaranta on For Your Eyes Only:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFor Your Eyes Only is a curatorial concept that aims to stimulate a conversation with contemporary artists about the future of human visual culture, and to investigate how they are working, in different ways, on the development of a visual language capable to resist the machine gaze and its implications, and to improve human visual communication‚Äîa post-AI, posthuman human vision. The exhibition includes images of diverse nature and origin, submitted as answers to the questions [of machine vision and the human gaze]. And yet, images can be used like words, but they are not words. They can be paraphrased, explained, and described, but no description will ever exhaust them. They can be used like answers, but they are rather proofs. They have been sent by a human to another human, each of them carrying much more than what I asked for. They are not delivering an answer, they are the answer. Try to read them, and you‚Äôll soon find out that they have as many readings as readers. Enjoy, they‚Äôre for your eyes only.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Ethereum Bridge Completed&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File‚Äôs Ethereum Bridge now supports all past exhibitions. You can see this option when you view an artwork as shown in the image below.&lt;br/&gt;
When collectors use our Ethereum Bridge to transfer an NFT from the Bitmark blockchain to the Ethereum blockchain, their Bitmark Certificate is replaced with an ERC-721 standard NFT. There‚Äôs an Ethereum gas fee associated with this, required by the Ethereum network to create that new NFT; the collector pays for the gas when they choose to move their Feral File NFT to the Ethereum blockchain. Our Bridge preserves the provenance of the artwork edition, other metadata such as the contract, and the artwork itself. This is done by creating a new IPFS directory containing the data and referencing it in the ERC-721. That‚Äôs how Feral File maintains&lt;br/&gt;
the artist and collector rights&lt;br/&gt;
across the trust boundary between the Bitmark and Ethereum blockchains.&lt;br/&gt;
Coming up next, we‚Äôll continue to work on optimizations for OpenSea, such as displaying the artist‚Äôs name with the artwork. This is an OpenSea-specific customization ‚Äî this information is already properly formatted within the ERC-721 spec.&lt;br/&gt;
MoMA Benefits for Refik Anadol‚Äôs Unsupervised Collectors&lt;br/&gt;
As part of our collaboration with the Museum of Modern Art, original owners of the 1/1 series and the nine editions of 100 series will be entitled to a free one year Access membership at MoMA. These include both on-location and internet-based benefits. We will be sending an email to these individuals with more information on how to redeem it in the next week ‚Äî we&amp;#x27;re working hard with Refik and MoMA to get this done quickly.&lt;br/&gt;

Nodes and Edges: Social Codes Curator‚Äôs Note&lt;br/&gt;
Casey Reas&lt;br/&gt;
For the last twenty five years, I‚Äôve shared my time and ideas with artists who write code. The internet has always been essential for us, because the web isn‚Äôt just a space for documentation‚Äîit‚Äôs the main place where our work is shared and discussed. For many of us, the internet is also the primary place to exhibit work, and be in community. The Social Codes online exhibition is a view into this community of hybrid artists/coders in 2021.&lt;br/&gt;
Social Codes is an exhibition of software art, also called generative art. All of the work is comprised of code written by artists to create visual experiences. Some works in the exhibition relate to the visual histories of drawing, painting, animation, and video, but all of it is native digital art, in that each artwork is a performance of code choreographed by the artist.&lt;br/&gt;
Artists have been working with code since the 1960s, and within that time frame, code has evolved from languages written by engineers to run on room-sized computers to artist-created coding languages running inside a web browser. In 2021, artists are writing code in many languages and environments. Each programming language is like a different material to work with.&lt;br/&gt;
As I started working on this exhibition in September 2020, I asked the following on Twitter: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm researching ‚Äògenerative art‚Äô on ‚Äòsocial media‚Äô with a focus on the ~present. Who‚Äôs doing the most interesting work in this space? Twitter, Instagram, Tumblr, OpenProcessing, etc. What do you think?‚Äù Over a few days we created a&lt;br/&gt;
public document&lt;br/&gt;
with a crowdsourced list of over three hundred people. This was the seed that grew into this exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;
In Social Codes, the artists‚Äô works are presented together in an intentional way, instead of spread out across different online platforms and accounts. The majority of the work in Social Codes is related to the coding platform Processing and the JavaScript library p5.js. As one of the co-founders of Processing,I‚Äôm tuned into that community more than others, so the artwork in Social Codes clearly doesn‚Äôt represent everything happening within this online space right now. So, if this is your first time seeing this type work, I hope you‚Äôll go on to seek out more of it. There are decades of amazing works to explore, all through your browser.&lt;br/&gt;
Anna Carreras‚Äô&lt;br/&gt;
work has a strong relationship to the Spanish landscape where she spends her time, and her piece in Social Codes, ‚ÄúArrels,‚Äù connects drawing, code, and the environment through a cycle of growth and decay. While Anna looks to nature for the source of her work, she interprets and transforms her experience into carefully choreographed generative animation. In ‚ÄúArrels,‚Äù growing tendrils the color of earth and sky collide in a vibrant dance. New growth in the arid soil overtakes the old, and the cycle continues.&lt;br/&gt;
Andrew Benson&lt;br/&gt;
is a video feedback aesthete who works with code intuitively, and ‚ÄúScrampled‚Äù is an iconic example of his bright and gestural software paintings. To make his animations, he creates his own software tools the way a traditional craftsperson might build a custom tool for a specific task. In this way, Andrew creates bespoke software that is completely tailored to his process, and unlike code written by anyone else. When ‚ÄúScrampled‚Äù is started, a series of gestural lines are drawn to the screen, and as other gestures begin to excise and copy textures, a new visual world unfolds. The process of mark-making and mark-interrupting becomes a feedback loop that pushes and pulls pixels across the screen in a luscious dance.&lt;br/&gt;
Dave Whyte&lt;br/&gt;
is in a category by himself in creating code-generated looping animations. Through early machines like the praxinoscope and zoetrope, animation in this style has been created and enjoyed for nearly 200 years‚Äîbut with his attention to the subtleties of motion and perception, Dave has pushed the medium further than anyone else. His online Bees &amp;amp; Bombs media accounts are deep collections of striking motion studies, and his ‚ÄúShimmer‚Äù software in Social Codes is an evolution of his work that moves it toward direct presentation of the software, rather than as a fixed, looping animation created from code.&lt;br/&gt;
LIA&lt;br/&gt;
was a pioneer in creating internet art in the 1990s, and since then, she has continued to experiment and explore into the present. Her latest work, ‚Äúdada data,‚Äù is aligned with her early works in its focus on minimal, generative animation. With a red dot as a focal point, a network of lines undulate and coil left and right in a way that nods to Marcel Duchamp‚Äôs hypnotic ‚ÄúRotoreliefs.‚Äù Although the linear forms that comprise ‚Äúdada data‚Äù are minimal, the motion is complex and entirely engrossing.&lt;br/&gt;
Manolo Gamboa Naon&lt;br/&gt;
has been called the first prodigy of generative art. While he deflects this praise, those of us who know his work know that it‚Äôs true. In an incredible burst of energy from 2014 to 2020, Manolo created a sequence of images unlike anything seen before, which went on to influence the next generation of artists who code. After a pause from exhibiting work, he‚Äôs returning to premiere the vivid ‚Äúuneasy dream‚Äù, a continuously-evolving generative animation that surges, expands, and contracts in an ongoing flow.&lt;br/&gt;
Raven Kwok‚Äôs&lt;br/&gt;
work is always inventive and meticulous, and ‚ÄúIDE94‚Äù, his piece in Social Codes, is no different. ‚ÄúIDE94‚Äù is a generative visual artwork based on a two-dimensional tree map structure. Its random yet organic visual texture and motion pattern are created by controlling nodes on every recursion level of the tree structure, and by assigning a position for each node, Kwok dynamically changes the density and pattern of the consecutive line segments within the finite space. ‚ÄúIDE94‚Äù is a semi-automatic artwork; it constantly changes its own geometry, but at any moment the viewer can pull and stretch it apart, only to watch it return to its starting point, step by step.&lt;br/&gt;
Dmitri Cherniak‚Äôs&lt;br/&gt;
artistic medium is automation. He creates intricate code systems that generate a wide range of images and animations, and over the last few years, he has produced work at an intense pace, posting the results daily to his Instagram account. Scrolling through his feed feels like touring through a tightly controlled explosion of ideas. In his new work, ‚ÄúTransparent Grit‚Äù, ethereal lenses orbit around a fixed point. The captivating result feels like it could represent any scale, from a vast galaxy, to a tiny atom. As another way to play with scale, the viewer can change the work‚Äôs dimensions to view ‚ÄúTransparent Grit‚Äù from a distance, or from the inside.&lt;br/&gt;
Maya Man‚Äôs&lt;br/&gt;
unique contribution to Social Codes offers a new way to think about software and performance. Her deep explorations in art, dance, and code come together in ‚Äúcan I go where you go?‚Äù As a video clip of Maya dancing plays, her code analyzes the video frames one by one to generate a silhouette. This contour becomes an ever-changing shape the viewer can take charge of by drawing with it, or they can simply watch as the software performs itself.&lt;br/&gt;
Saskia Freeke&lt;br/&gt;
has created new coded visuals every day since January 2015, posting these ‚Äúdailies‚Äù online as a kind of public sketchbook. Her ‚Äúenchanting luxuriance‚Äù software brings some of the ideas explored through this daily practice together into a refined world of abstracted interfaces. As the viewer watches, containers of geometric grids float slowly upward, each one obstructing others from view. As the individual elements vie for our attention, each grid conforms to its container while pulsing with vibrant color gradations.&lt;br/&gt;
Frederik Vanhoutte&lt;br/&gt;
has pushed his work into a new direction with ‚ÄúLamia‚Äù, an isometric presentation of the poem with the same name written by John Keats in 1819. The work cycles through the 728 lines of the poem, with one line presented every 8 seconds, so it takes 97 minutes for the entire text to cycle back to the start. The selected 3√ó3 pixel font intentionally obscures the text, but with practice, it can indeed be read. Frederik is interested in two interpretations of the poem: first, as a way to express the idea that scientific knowledge doesn‚Äôt destroy the romantic idea of beauty; and second, as a cautionary tale of misguided cultural subversion.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Rick Silva on Fragments of a Hologram Rose:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe artists featured in this exhibition were asked to imagine and create their own sci-fi plants‚Äîwhether it be by rendering an alien pollen, some photosynthetic architecture, or a flower whose weirdness is only revealed by its description.&lt;br/&gt;
Like botanists from a parallel future or an unknown world, these artists cultivate their fictions into existence. They sub-scatter seed pods, prune polygon cuttings, give their models plenty of volumetric lighting, and soak with fluid simulations. The 3D objects in this exhibition have secret pathways and telepathic tendrils. They bloom on neon skins and disperse nano mold spores through LCD screens.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
As for the title, ‚ÄúThis exhibition borrows its name from Willliam Gibson‚Äôs first published short story, ‚ÄòFragments of a Hologram Rose‚Äô (1977). As the story notes, when a hologram is cut into pieces, even the smallest section still contains the whole of the image. In a similar way, plant cuttings and an edition of digital works can both hold these mirroring elements of origin and multiplicity.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Andrew Thomas Huang ‚Äî Mutant Bagua&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Mutant Bagua is a 3D sculptural reinterpretation of the Taoist Bagua (ÂÖ´Âç¶) as a machine-spirit interface. By uploading ancient Taoist script into virtual form, the work serves as an ancestral portal to digital spirits that haunt the interface between Taoist structural code and digital data.&lt;br/&gt;
Sabrina Ratt√© ‚Äî Floralia II&lt;br/&gt;

Floralia II is part of a series inspired by the writings of Donna J. Haraway, Ursula K. Le Guin, and Greg Egan. The work plunges us into a speculative future where samples of then-extinct plant species are preserved and displayed in a virtual archive room. Floralia II is a simulation of ecosystems born from the fusion of technology and organic matter, where past and future coexist in the perpetual tension of the present.&lt;br/&gt;
Lawrence Lek ‚Äî Temple Lily&lt;br/&gt;

As Lek describes his imagined specimen: ‚ÄúThe rare Temple Lily requires music in order to grow, and higher frequencies cause the flower‚Äôs characteristic interference pattern on its petals. Widely known for its therapeutic and healing qualities, multiple attempts have been made to clone the flower for pharmaceutical purposes. Despite these attempts, only several known specimens currently exist.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce the platform‚Äôs fourth exhibition, which will feature new editioned NFTs by a group of seven international artists:&lt;br/&gt;
Cao Shu (Hangzhou)&lt;br/&gt;
Guo Cheng (Shanghai) &amp;amp; Weihao Qiu (Irvine, CA)&lt;br/&gt;
He Zike (Beijing)&lt;br/&gt;
Shi Zheng (Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;
Lin Ke (Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;
In_K (Beijing)&lt;br/&gt;
Studio Above&amp;amp;Below (London)&lt;br/&gt;
Each artwork is an edition of 75, each sold for $75 USD.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Iris Long on The Long Cut:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe exhibition ‚ÄòThe Long Cut‚Äô features works that investigate the remote, latent, and liminal space of technologies, and how this awareness can trigger alternative pathways and maps for our shared technological reality. More importantly, it investigates how artists navigate between the perspectives of the ‚ÄòProgress-tracer‚Äô and ‚ÄòTopology-mancer‚Äô‚Äîtwo fictional personas representing different approaches to understanding reality‚Äîin order to find their own way of living with the hybridity of the physical and the digital.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Studio Above&amp;amp;Below ‚Äî Steering Pixels&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSteering Pixels‚Äù was born through a fluid simulation interpreted through a generative adversarial network (GAN), which was trained on hundreds of images of ever-changing water surfaces‚Äîdata collected and sculpted by the artists. Machine vision and machine learning techniques are used to document changing environments to lead to multiple, unexpected, and diverse perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;
Guo Cheng &amp;amp; Weihao Qiu ‚Äî Abstract Oracle Miner 0009328437&lt;br/&gt;
Abstract Oracle Miner by Guo Cheng &amp;amp; Weihao Qiu. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAbstract Oracle Miner 0009328437&amp;quot; generates visual prophecies through rendering several complex 3D scenes. During the process, the temperature of hardware running the webpage may rise, the cooling fan may generate noises and the image rendering may slow down. In other words, the ‚Äúoracle&amp;quot; takes the offering from the hardware‚Äîthe foundational structure of the virtual world, reminding viewers that the ‚Äúvirtual&amp;quot; is by no means effortless, weightless, or light as a feather.&lt;br/&gt;
Shi Zheng ‚Äî Free Fall Study III&lt;br/&gt;
Free Fall Study III by Shi Zheng. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Shi Zheng‚Äôs ‚ÄúFree Fall Study III‚Äù captures a computer-simulated mask that keeps falling downwards. A computer-vision facial recognition system identifies whether the image of each falling mask matches the features of a human face. Numbers between 0.0 and 1.0 represent the approximation value of ‚Äúhuman&amp;quot; identified by the machine compared to a ‚Äúreal human.‚Äù The face-detection algorithms in this work programmatically translate complex human-face information into numbers, which end up overly simplifying the diversity of what a face looks like. Thus, the falling ‚Äúmask‚Äù in the work not only physically embodies products‚Äîincluding facial processing and digital filters‚Äîbut it also epitomizes what it means to be ‚Äúhuman‚Äù in our data-flooded era.&lt;br/&gt;

Each artwork will be released as an edition of 75, with each edition priced at $75 USD.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Pau Waelder on Instructions Follow:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe artworks in Instructions Follow explore our relationships with digital devices and information systems from the perspectives of both humans and machines. Overall, the exhibition is a reflection on the instructions and codes that have always been a part of our societies.&lt;br/&gt;
Each artist addresses the notion of ¬´instructions¬ª from their own conceptual perspective, focusing on the aspects that directly relate to the subjects they explore in their own unique practice. Hence, the exhibition is characterized by the diversity of the artworks‚Äîboth in their formal approach, format, and behavior‚Äîwith some of them establishing a direct interaction with the viewer, whose actions inform the ultimate contents of the piece.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Solim√°n L√≥pez ‚Äî Neonumens&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚ÄúNeonumens,‚Äù Solim√°n L√≥pez plays with the notion of social media influencers as modern-day pagan deities, extending their power over the masses of believers who worship them. Two images from the Instagram feed of Brazilian beauty blogger Camila Coelho are recreated using 3D libraries and image recognition software, and then incorporated into a virtual installation. A video created by the artist explores the simulated piece, a composition that is reminiscent of both an altarpiece and a futuristic shop window display.&lt;br/&gt;
Lauren Lee McCarthy ‚Äî What do you want me to say?&lt;br/&gt;
What do you want me to say? by Lauren Lee McCarthy. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚ÄúWhat do you want me to say?,‚Äù Lauren Lee McCarthy reflects on the ways femme-voiced virtual assistants are commanded and controlled by their users and developers. In her own words:&lt;br/&gt;
¬´Exhausted by Zoom calls, I created a digital clone of my voice to replace me. Upon collecting and visiting the work, you are asked by my voice, ‚ÄòWhat do you want me to say?‚Äô However you reply, my voice responds by speaking your own words back to you. Then it asks again, ‚ÄòWhat do you want me to say?‚Äô¬ª&lt;br/&gt;
For the first month of the exhibition, this interactive work will be fully accessible to anyone. After this period, collectors alone will have access to the interactive version for a full year. Then, after one year, the piece will convert into an archive playback version, which will include the set of phrases her voice was instructed to say by various viewers over the course of the year.&lt;br/&gt;
Antoine Schmitt ‚Äî Minos&lt;br/&gt;
Minos by Antoine Schmitt. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMinos‚Äù is an interactive game based on the well-known Greek myth in which the player, in the role of Theseus, has to escape an invisible maze before getting caught by a Minotaur. Conceptually, the game explores the unspoken rules and codes that we encounter in our daily lives, whether on the level of administrative regulations, social behavior, or software. The player has to discover the rules by playing, and in that sense, it is a game with instructions that follow.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Luba Elliott on Reflections in the Water:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLooking into a still pond, we see a clear, gently blurred version of ourselves staring back at us, while turbulent waters return mere rippled echoes of our shape. These changing reflections of ourselves are similar to images generated from data, which can be hyperrealistic depictions of the original, or images that are surreal and barely recognizable, as flaws and errors creep in.&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water looks at the way artists represent nature and humans, using the latest machine learning technologies to conjure seascapes, imaginary marine creatures, autumn leaves as well as musing on the human form, its shapes and possibilities. Masks and faces akin to the grotesque rear their heads, reminding us both of the early errors of these technologies and the eternal human fascination with depicting ourselves. These artists present AI as a tool to both craft new reflections on perennial subject matters as well as a creative partner, conjuring new landscapes, creatures, and human forms.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Mario Klingemann ‚Äî Vague Recollection&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Mario Klingemann‚Äôs ‚ÄúVague Recollection‚Äù explores the nature of memory, time, and their interplay with AI. In this work, we see a face form in the monochrome stillness, a fleeting memory of a human as rendered by a neural network, unable to commit the exact features and distinguishing particularities.  The work is based on a neural network embedded in the browser, which attempts to remember an encounter in time. As the time vector approaches the point where the recollection is the strongest for a brief moment we can observe the memory fragments forming a face only to disperse again as the vector continues its trajectory in latent space.&lt;br/&gt;
Entangled Others ‚Äî There once was a jellyfish ...&lt;br/&gt;
There once was a jellyfish ‚Ä¶ by Entangled Others. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThere once was a jellyfish ‚Ä¶‚Äù is a piece that exemplifies Entangled Others‚Äô fascination with the marine world, particularly with jellyfish. Initially with a phobia of jellyfish as a child, Sofia Crespo, one-half of the artist duo, has developed a curiosity into its visual elements, including its dimensions, physical size, and appearance as well as its average lifespan. The typical life-cycle of a jellyfish spans multiple stages, some involving cloning, which result in potentially countless expressions of itself across a variety of stages, some even potentially in reverse. As humans, we only catch glimpses of jellyfish; our presence for minutes, days, or even a year may not be at all adequate to chart even a single gelatinous life in the depths of the ocean. Here, AI helps‚Äîits generative abilities and imagination help us bridge the divide between our life form and others.&lt;br/&gt;
Vadim Epstein ‚Äî Pixie&lt;br/&gt;
Pixie by Vadim Epstein. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Vadim Epstein‚Äôs ‚ÄúPixie‚Äù is a piece from an ongoing series using art imagery to  explore the emergence of complexity. The neural network in this piece has been used here recurrently, reprocessing its own output without any additional inputs, as if jammed between broken mirrors. The models have been trained on a dataset that encompasses various figurative imagery ‚Äî from photography to rough drawings ‚Äî to enrich and intensify the visual experience. Part of the training data was synthetic itself: some of the source datasets were generated, adding another layer of mediation and thus distancing it even further from the real. Eventually, we observe an ever-changing, shape-shifting, loosely-controlled abstract flux, which appears more lifelike on its own, rather than the  flashing snapshots of stiff flesh, stuck in convolutions.&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce the platform‚Äôs eighth exhibition, and first solo exhibition, featuring nine sound works by the electronic music composer Jan St. Werner. This audio-only exhibition puts sound at the forefront, positioning it at the same level as visual work within the framework of digital art. The individual compositions and complete sets will be made available to collectors as editioned NFTs. Each composition will be released as an edition of 90, with each priced at 110 USDC, and the 60 complete sets available are priced at 990 USDC.&lt;br/&gt;
Jan St. Werner on Polyarrythmia:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPolyarrythmia is an album or an exhibition or a selection of pieces, or maybe just a narrative in sound. None of the compositions have a strict metronome; there is no click or clock. The album as a whole has these interlocking peaks, micro-moments and movements, and then larger arcs, which meet and then disperse. To me that is very much what rhythm is, thus the name Polyarrythmia.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe compositions were mastered to be as present and intense as possible. The actual files that people download when they collect will provide the maximum resolution that people will be able to play back. I‚Äôm happy for listeners to experience the compositions separately, but to me, Polyarrythmia is a set, it‚Äôs a narrative as a whole. The pieces were all constructed in relation to each other, based on a visionary brain space, let‚Äôs call it. I was thinking, how far can I let these things drift off? How much space can I give it to unfold and go its own way? When I draw it back, that‚Äôs what becomes an individual composition or a piece.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPolyarrythmia could be a musical. The whole record has this cabaret connotation, with the sounds doing odd things, stepping up or doing a weird little trick, or waving its hand and having a mustache or something.  I also perceive it symphonically, an orchestra of unknown instruments. After all, maybe we still have to figure out what sound is. Maybe it helps to reconsider that idea. Hopefully some people will experience this exhibition not just as sound-based, but as something physical as well, a reconsideration of perceptual signal flow.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Jan St. Werner&lt;br/&gt;
Jan St. Werner is an artist and electronic music composer based in Berlin. Widely recognized as one half of the electronic music group Mouse on Mars, he has also pursued a solo career creating sound works under his own name as well as Lithops, Noisemashinetapes, and Neuter River. Starting in the mid-1990s as part of Cologne‚Äôs A-Musik collective, St. Werner has released a steady stream of records both as a solo artist and with Mouse on Mars. He has collaborated with Oval‚Äôs Markus Popp as Microstoria and contributes music for installations and films by visual artist Rosa Barba. During the 2000s Werner acted as the artistic director for STEIM, the Dutch Studio for Electro-Instrumental Music. In 2013 St. Werner released Blaze Colour Burn, the first of a series of experimental recordings called the Fiepblatter Catalogue. St. Werner realized sound interventions and installations in art spaces such as the ICA London, documenta Athen and Kassel, Kunsthalle Duesselorf, HKW Berlin, Lenbachhaus Munich. Werner has been a visiting Professor at MIT‚Äôs Program in Art, Culture and Technology (ACT) in 2016 &amp;amp; 2017, served as Professor for Dynamic Acoustic Research (DAF) at the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg between 2017 and 2021 and was a visiting Professor for Sound and Performance at the Academy of Fine Arts Munich. He is currently Artist in House at Staatliche Kunsthalle Baden-Baden, Germany.&lt;br/&gt;

Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce the gallery‚Äôs tenth exhibition, featuring plotter drawings from six international artists who are transforming how code is rendered through drawing machines.&lt;br/&gt;
Participating artists:&lt;br/&gt;
Aleksandra Jovaniƒá (Serbia)&lt;br/&gt;
Iskra Velitchkova (Spain)&lt;br/&gt;
James Merrill (United States)&lt;br/&gt;
Julien Gachadoat (France)&lt;br/&gt;
Licia He (United States)&lt;br/&gt;
Tyler Hobbs (United States)&lt;br/&gt;
Each of the artists in ‚ÄìGRAPH has created one software artwork that creates 30 unique physical drawings. Twelve sets (bundles of all six works) will be made available to collectors, as well as 11 of the editions from each artist. The pieces will be auctioned to the highest bidders, and the first collector of each edition will receive the corresponding plotter drawing shipped directly from the artist‚Äôs studio. Each software NFT includes millions of other compositions that are embedded in the software that can be viewed through an interface created by each artist.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Casey Reas on ‚ÄìGRAPH:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúWhen I made my first plotter drawings, I can say without exaggeration that it completely transformed my understanding of the history of computer-generated drawings. Before, I had vaguely understood how they were created, but now I felt their production in detail... Each drawing is truly unique and is often the result of careful physical adjustments and extreme patience.&lt;br/&gt;
Making plotter drawings is difficult and wonderful, and the artists in ‚ÄìGRAPH are passionate about this medium. These artists all share a love of working with visual systems and writing code, and transforming how the code is rendered through drawing machines.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Julien Gachadoat ‚Äî Umwelt&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Julien Gachadoat‚Äôs ‚ÄúUmwelt‚Äù relies on the combination of a subdivision algorithm and a curved-line-drawing algorithm to produce a set of minimalist compositions. Each image in the series is the result of partitioning a square into a series of smaller areas and then filling those areas with a dense group of curved lines. The spacing of these lines, their orientation, and their precise curvature are defined by harmonic functions that create rhythms within a spatial geometric melody.&lt;br/&gt;
Aleksandra Jovaniƒá ‚Äî (The illusion of) depth of knowledge&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú(The illusion of) depth of knowledge‚Äù by Aleksandra Jovaniƒá. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚Äú(The illusion of) depth of knowledge,‚Äù Aleksandra Jovaniƒá explores apophenia, the tendency to perceive a connection or meaningful pattern between unrelated or random things. Each drawing in the series is generated through random numbers, but the internal connections suggest that more is happening. In Aleksandra‚Äôs words, these images show ‚Äúhow things in life are pretty simple most of the time, but we tend to complicate them.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Iskra Velitchkova ‚Äî ‚ÄúCHERTI‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúCHERTI‚Äù by Iskra Velitchkova. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Iskra Velitchkova‚Äôs ‚ÄúCHERTI‚Äù is a series of drawings that explore the relationship between physical drawings and software drawings. On that topic, Iskra writes, ‚ÄúThe difference between digital and physical allows me to see the process itself. The constraints of the pen, the paper, and many other circumstances that only happen in real life make me more aware of how much we can learn from technology and its capacity to produce complexity.‚Äù The software drawing seen in the web browser is a small window of the full composition, to show more detail. The physical drawing reveals the whole picture, and both views are displayed together to convey this relationship.&lt;br/&gt;
Chaos Blocks ‚Äî James Merrill&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúChaos Blocks‚Äù by James Merrill. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
James Merrill‚Äôs ‚ÄúChaos Blocks‚Äù drawings explore the tension between order and chaos. Each drawing in the series is reminiscent of a geological drawing, and we see them created on the screen as each layer draws on top of the next. After the layers are created, each is filled with an unexpected, vibrant pattern. James is reacting against the inhuman perfection that often characterizes visual art created through machines. With this focus, his work has a strong relationship to many of the first plotter drawings created in the 1960s that explored randomness to circumvent precision. James amplifies this further with his library of dense and meticulous patterns.&lt;br/&gt;
Licia He ‚Äî Endless Monologue&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúEndless Monologue‚Äù by Licia He. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
With ‚ÄúEndless Monologue,‚Äù Licia He reflects on questions that she subconsciously asks herself like, ‚ÄúWho am I?‚Äù and ‚ÄúIs this correct?‚Äù In thinking about these repetitive and constant questions, she writes, ‚ÄúThey are soft murmurs yet enormously demanding. They are intricate but chaotic. Gloomy or bright, they are all colorful, tangled, and bizarre.‚Äù A selection of 31 phrases from her internal monologues are the seeds for the random number generator that defines each artwork in the series. The visual manifestation is a dense surface of flowing curves that intersect and create networks. When she uses paint and brushes to translate her images from code to paper, these lines merge into solid blocks as the paint spreads through the paper.&lt;br/&gt;
F(l)ight  ‚Äî Tyler Hobbs&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúF(l)ight‚Äù by Tyler Hobbs. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Tyler Hobbs‚Äô ‚ÄúF(l)ight‚Äù a study of the aesthetic overlap and differences between the natural world, hand-made artwork, and algorithmic tendencies. It‚Äôs a return to his long-standing interests in the continuum of representational images to total abstraction. In relation to his idea that code and algorithms become increasingly important within culture and art, Tyler says, ‚ÄúI am interested in what parts of the analog world we can capture, what we can improve, and what is lost.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Domenico Quaranta on For Your Eyes Only:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFor Your Eyes Only is a curatorial concept that aims to stimulate a conversation with contemporary artists about the future of human visual culture, and to investigate how they are working, in different ways, on the development of a visual language capable to resist the machine gaze and its implications, and to improve human visual communication‚Äîa post-AI, posthuman human vision. The exhibition includes images of diverse nature and origin, submitted as answers to the questions [of machine vision and the human gaze]. And yet, images can be used like words, but they are not words. They can be paraphrased, explained, and described, but no description will ever exhaust them. They can be used like answers, but they are rather proofs. They have been sent by a human to another human, each of them carrying much more than what I asked for. They are not delivering an answer, they are the answer. Try to read them, and you‚Äôll soon find out that they have as many readings as readers. Enjoy, they‚Äôre for your eyes only.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Petra Cortright ‚Äî smoking-vase-1&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Like the webcam videos Cortright has been working on since 2007, ‚Äúsmoking-vase-1‚Äù was filmed with no post production, just live use of standard webcam software. Similar to Instagram or Snapchat videos, the effects are part of the original recording, but by contrast, ‚Äúsmoking-vase-1‚Äù is not part of a networked system designed for data mining and facial recognition. The looping animation is slow, simple, and with a focus on beauty, which led Cortright to her choice of subject as well as the obsolete filter. To shoot ‚Äúsmoking-vase-1,‚Äù Cortright used an old 2014 Mac OS, which gives the image a vintage flavor. A favorite subject of her digital paintings, flowers are featured here as a fragile metaphor of time passing, of a relationship between the real and digital sphere that is ever evolving, never the same.&lt;br/&gt;
Jonas Lund ‚Äî Smart Cut&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSmart Cut‚Äù by Jonas Lund. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
According to the art critic Arthur C. Danto, ‚ÄúTo see something as art requires something the eye cannot decry‚Äîan atmosphere of artistic theory, a knowledge of the history of art: an artworld.‚Äù Since 2014, Jonas Lund has been making abstract paintings using elements sampled from paintings by other emerging artists, optimized for market success. The morphing animations in ‚ÄúSmart Cut‚Äù are made out of images from this series that were not selected for production: works as part of the process, works as they were before they got ‚Äúgood,‚Äù left-over abstractions. Turned into animations, these discarded images‚Äînot art, according to Lund&amp;#x27;s ‚Äúartistic theory‚Äù‚Äîhave been selected by a smart cut algorithm as the best ones and automatically pieced together.&lt;br/&gt;
Katja Novitskova ‚Äî ‚ÄúPatterns of Activation (gardens of the galaxy)‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPatterns of Activation (gardens of the galaxy)‚Äù by Katja Novitskova. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPatterns of Activation (gardens of the galaxy)‚Äù is a GIF assemblage of images from various datasets the artist indexed on a citizen science platform, where volunteers are asked to index, draw on, and categorize images from various datasets, usually with the goal of training image processing AI algorithms. The images Novitskova worked on mostly include wildlife cam photos, astronomy, snail embryos, and monkey blood cells. If the overabundance of instrumental, machine-readable images may cheapen any meaning or aesthetic value, Novitskova actively digs some poetry out of these datasets. Such poetry comes from a combination of technology and the reality that it attempts to capture: glowing eyes of animals that reflect the flash-light of the camera, digital low resolution artifacts, accidentally stunning compositions of galaxies and forests, etc. The GIFs mechanical speed is faster than the usual human perception‚Äîit is functional to the machine gaze, but in itself it creates a new type of poetic image, too.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Jason Bailey on Field Guide:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúRather than act as a mirror, dutifully recreating or reporting back on the world around us, these artists often act as a portal to an entirely new universe. A universe where the artist has crafted unique entities from scratch through many compressed cycles of evolution. A universe where fascinating beings and impossible environments blend the foreign and the familiar, giving us a sense that there is life here, but perhaps not life as we‚Äôve known it.&lt;br/&gt;
In this show I wanted to focus on the artistic process for each artist, highlighting how the proliferation of work afforded by digital tools often leads the artist to spend as much time curating as creating. However, it can be hard for the viewer to gather much context when looking at just one or two works by an artist. So as part of my prompt, I also asked them to leverage Edward Tufte‚Äôs concept of small multiples. Small multiples display a set of images in close proximity together, typically in a grid-like pattern, to facilitate comparisons across the full group of images at a glance.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Hypothetically Micro ‚Äî Iskra Velitchkova&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúHypothetically Micro‚Äù confronts us with a dozen bold ribbon-like entities placed against flat backgrounds of solid color. Familiar on the surface, they become increasingly difficult to place, particularly in terms of scale. Velitchkova‚Äôs lyrical specimens are artfully cropped in a way that suggests we may be looking at the tail, wing, fin, or frond of a much larger organism. Yet something about the color palette also recalls the dyes used in microscopy: These forms could just as easily be microorganisms as much larger birdlike or fishlike creatures. Her work shines next to other generative artists for its elegant biomorphic forms and subtle exploration of color. Velitchkova is a magnificent biological architect, painstakingly crafting visual systems while bringing delicate new creatures to life.&lt;br/&gt;
Jared S Tarbell ‚Äî Entity&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúEntity‚Äù by Jared S Tarbell. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúEntity‚Äù is a wonderful dance of life. Colorful microorganisms are born, engage in naturalistic individual and group behaviors, evolve, and then terminate, making room for new specimens to emerge. The balletic choreography is governed not by linear animation but through the artist‚Äôs deep exploration and understanding of force-repulsion fields. Indeed, work with this complexity and nuance would seem impossible to animate by hand and feels closer to systems and behaviors we are accustomed to seeing only in nature. Such is the unique brilliance of Jared S Tarbell that his work does not capture nature, it rivals it.&lt;br/&gt;
This work is a programmed system and the video artifact was a capture of live interaction by the artist. The collectors will receive the interactive software as part of the acquisition. The music in this piece is ‚ÄúInfinity Machine‚Äù by Tonepoet.&lt;br/&gt;
Ilya Shkipin ‚Äî Blooming Valetudinarian&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúBlooming Valetudinarian‚Äù by Ilya Shkipin. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúBlooming Valetudinarian‚Äù is a stunning interplay between attraction and repulsion. As a group, the forms read as 100 beautiful winged insects, a diverse entomological collection of moths or butterflies. But upon closer examination, many of the butterflies reveal a surreal vignette of entangled biomorphic forms that feel voyeuristic if not bordering on pornographic. Shkipin‚Äôs specimens elicit unsettling emotions similar to works from Egon Schiele or Francis Bacon. The images pull in just enough elements from reality to hint at the familiar, while largely leaving us on our own to fill in the blanks. The emotional resonance, compositional awareness, and sensitivity to color, brought by Shkipin highlight what neural networks like CLIP are capable of when placed in the hands of a true artist.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator symbios.wiki on Primordium:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúA primordium is an organ at the earliest stages of development, a mass of cell tissue teeming with potentiality. For Sage Jenson, primordium is material at the precipice of desire, and their material of choice. Their work functions in the aesthetics of immanence; a place where machinic systems imbue each other with unending possibility, a world in motion, out of equilibrium, and pulsating with unstable flows. Each piece in Primordium, their solo exhibition, embodies this sense of becoming, hypnotizing the viewer with an ever-unfolding actualization of the shadow future.&lt;br/&gt;
In each of the works in the show, there are agents (particles) that can sense, navigate, and modify their environment. The environment acts as both an arena and a message board for the agents. All of the shapes and patterns within the pieces are emergent behaviors within a rich parameter space. In one sense, the behavior of the agents can be viewed as a reaction to the current state of the environment, and in another, the environment is a creation of the agents‚Äô will upon it.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
36 Points#07 (enmeshed_singularities)&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚Äú36 Points,‚Äù the keyboard is an instrument for traversing curated locales within the phase space of a home-grown bio-sim. A multitude of particle-agents inhabit this playable terrarium. Their emergent behavior feeds-back and folds onto itself to create a rich and evolving primordium, teeming with material potentiality. The system yearns for the next keystroke, a symphony vibrating within a virtual membrane.&lt;br/&gt;
Each edition provides the collector with a unique system state that is loaded at instantiation. To access any of the other points, the user may press keys 0-9 or a-z, and the system will interpolate into its new state. However, the point will drift back to its original configuration over time.&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú36 Points‚Äù culminates three years of research into Sage‚Äôs first web-based instrument. The embedding of the system within the web is intentional, as browsers offer cross compatibility and built-in interactivity. This also allows for the pieces to be collectable, yet open. It is interesting to note that the total file size of the work is 32kB and fits entirely within the metadata.&lt;br/&gt;
Embryogenesis&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúEmbryogenesis‚Äù by Sage Jenson. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In the summer of 2020, Sage set out to synthesize their previous experiments into an emergent virtual organism. They developed new particle behaviors and an artisanal rendering engine. Particles imbued with homeotic potentiality shapeshift into various behavioral species, and give life to a plethora of embryonic stages. In one particular experiment, this amalgamation beget an uncanny offspring, whose particular genetic code has been unreproducible, creating an anomaly, and a treasure.&lt;br/&gt;
The only remaining record of this creature is a 4,437 frame video detailing the poignant gaze of its emergent eye. ‚ÄúEmbryogenesis‚Äù represents a sort of&lt;br/&gt;
post-partum document&lt;br/&gt;
to the extinct resonances within the code. Forever trapped in a loop, lost to the symbolic order of memory.  It is with a heavy heart that Sage releases their spawn into the wild, but it is the inevitable eventuality of parenthood that children escape the petri dish.&lt;br/&gt;

Rafa√´l Rozendaal on Infinite Entropy:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe way I think visually is with lines ‚Äî it‚Äôs very simple, and very quick; it‚Äôs similar to drawing diagrams. But for this piece I was drawing circles, and though it‚Äôs still the simple instruction of a circle, I also added a level of transparency that I hadn‚Äôt used before. The content of the circle becomes transparent over the spreading out, the further you get from the center. As with all of my works, this one was made with a bunch of small steps ‚Äî the transparency was just one of those small steps, but it creates a very different visual result.&lt;br/&gt;
With this piece I also wanted to play with the idea of emptiness and things being filled up and busy. There‚Äôs constantly a tension between where you feel like there‚Äôs some space and where it feels very crowded. The script is simple: it‚Äôs just these circles moving from the center outward, getting bigger. They‚Äôre not moving towards you, but there is a false sense of depth, like moving through clouds. I‚Äôve always liked the kinds of paintings where you‚Äôre suggesting depth, but it‚Äôs barely there.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúInfinite Entropy 22‚Äù by Rafa√´l Rozendaal. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Infinite Entropy&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúInfinite Entropy‚Äù is a series of 25 unique works, each one with its own colors, rhythm, and scale. The script is relatively simple: colorful circles drift from the center of the composition outward, getting bigger as they go. The dense concentration of color at the center of each circle gets more transparent as the circle spreads, creating a soft halo that gives the piece a layered, fuzzy feel. The overall effect is quite different from Rafael Rozendaal‚Äôs usual harder-edged works, though the process of building it from simple shapes and small steps is the same. The circles look as if they‚Äôre moving toward the viewer, implying depth where there is none.&lt;br/&gt;
About Rafa√´l Rozendaal&lt;br/&gt;

are pleased to announce the gallery‚Äôs new solo exhibition with artist group Whistlegraph, who have created ten ‚Äúwhistlegraphs‚Äù ‚Äî an original art form of scored musical drawings ‚Äî for the show. Each work will be auctioned to the highest bidder. (&lt;br/&gt;

Writer Dorothy Rose Howard on Ten Whistlegraphs:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúIn Whistlegraph‚Äôs first solo show and exhibition, the artist group (Jeffrey Scudder, Camille Klein, Alex Freundlich) presents a new body of work featuring creative documentation of a selection of ‚Äúwhistlegraphs‚Äù ‚Äî memorizable lyrical poems that double as graphic scores, resulting in reproducible drawings.&lt;br/&gt;
Blending drawing with live performance documentation is Whistlegraph‚Äôs bread and butter; and it is this evasion of capture that also makes artifacts of their work so limitless. A set of files make up each of the ten whistlegraphs curated for Feral File ‚Äî a high definition video performance and graphic score made for the exhibition, in addition to a curated selection of TikToks of that same work, accessible through a custom interactive player. Each whistlegraph piece by the group has generated countless media artifacts and recordings in the form of social media posts (by Whistlegraph and fans alike), works on paper, and live recitals. Part of the beauty of this format is that once you grok it, you can make a whistlegraph yourself. Indeed many do write their own whistlegraphs‚Äîor interact with the group‚Äôs in the form of duets, mashups, and sing-alongs to the tune of digital folk.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
The show is accompanied by a text written by Dorothy Rose Howard.&lt;br/&gt;
About Whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
Whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
is composed of artists Jeffrey Scudder, Camille Klein, and Alex Freundlich, who draw, sing, and make videos together. The group formed during the 2020 pandemic in a cabin in Ashland, Oregon, which remains their creative base. Over the past few years, they have honed a distinctive style and practice that speaks to embodied cognition, art education, and experimental composition for live performance.&lt;br/&gt;
The group‚Äôs TikTok&lt;br/&gt;
@whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
is an important platform for their work, where they regularly engage with their 2.2 million current followers. Whistlegraph has also toured, performed, and led educational workshops at Kunstverein Hamburg (Germany), Rhizome, The Schneider Museum of Art (Ashland, OR), Oneroom Gallery (Providence, RI), Willem de Kooning Acadamie (Rotterdam, Netherlands), OCCII (Amsterdam, Netherlands), and the Banana School (Bananskole; Copenhagen, Denmark).&lt;br/&gt;

PSHH! PEW!&lt;br/&gt;
I love mommy WOWWWW&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMommy Wow‚Äù was composed improvisationally by Whistlegraph, each member taking turns. For this exhibition, ‚ÄúMommy Wow‚Äù is performed in the evening by Whistlegraph outside of the Schneider Museum of Art with Hagoromo Luminous chalk on brick.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPeople Pleaser‚Äù by Whistlegraph. Image courtesy of the artists and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
People Pleaser&lt;br/&gt;
Lyrics:&lt;br/&gt;
When you‚Äôre told ‚ÄúAmazing! Incredible‚Äù best beware&lt;br/&gt;
Someone‚Äôs always saying, words you wanna hear&lt;br/&gt;
Products of low self-esteem,&lt;br/&gt;
peacefully prove their being mildly mean&lt;br/&gt;
to those around them&lt;br/&gt;
At the time of its composition by Jeffrey Scudder, ‚ÄúPeople Pleaser‚Äù was the longest whistlegraph in the groups‚Äô repertoire. It is rendered here by Whistlegraph in pencil on a Kamiterior Memoterior Colors Memo Pad.&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce a week of five live streamed performances for the gallery‚Äôs latest exhibition, On Screen Presence.&lt;br/&gt;
Access Passes are available on May 23 with a 12-hour group auction. Live stream performances and auctions for 1/1 artworks begin on May 30 with 0xDEAFBEEF; and continue on May 31 with John F. Simon Jr.; June 1 with Wiena Lin; June 2 with Golan Levin; and June 3 with Molly Soda. Each performance is open to the public but an Access Pass includes an editioned recorded video of the performance and, for three of the performances, live interactivity. (&lt;br/&gt;
Please see the Price List for complete detail&lt;br/&gt;
)&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Regina Harsanyi on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLike most of the working world, arts workers were also spending more time in front of the screen on video conferencing software. The most intimate, bodied experience one could have was through a webcam in real-time. Although translated to ones and zeros, webcam video has the capacity to create a portal into ‚Äúreal‚Äù space beyond the screen, a space that doesn‚Äôt exist in polygon modeling but organic compounds. Access to another‚Äôs brick and mortar interior has the capacity to psychologically break through the flatness and connect onlookers to the ‚Äúother side.‚Äù Even with a rich 30-year history of what has been referred to as cyberformance, a dated term to describe performance art that often happens live and over the internet, these practices during the global lockdown remained on the fringes.&lt;br/&gt;
On Screen Presence began as a frustrated retaliation against scrolling through thumbnails of decontextualized artwork, both digitized and digitally native. This exhibition offers up live streamed presence of artists in their studio among tangible components in the production of their work. While still remaining just out of reach from corporeal intimacy, this selection of process art performances, which end with the creation of a singular work, are interactive. For a few minutes, viewers form a dynamic, active relationship with the artwork that at least temporarily veils isolated experience. Many of the works that will be created during the performances will be tangible, achieving a complete unchaining from the screen and into the hands of a single collector. Live engagement is ephemeral, leaving only the indexical recording of the process behind. And, incidentally, a majority of works in the program require a transient webpage ‚Äî a networked component to facilitate interactivity. Both factors are reminders that On Screen Presence never truly solves but only explores the problematics of computer screen archeology, equally as vulnerable to the digital dark age.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSketches in Iron‚Äù by 0xDEAFBEEF. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Sketches in Iron&lt;br/&gt;
Since 2020, 0xDEAFBEEF has been known primarily for creating generative audiovisual works that explore the limits of blockchain both technically and conceptually. For the first time, ‚ÄúSketches in Iron‚Äù combines the artist‚Äôs core interest in software with a lesser known facet of their background, metalworking. Pushing the boundary further between digital computation and a 6,000 year-old industrial practice that plays out through a choreographed live streamed performance, the artist introduces their own biological, mineral content as catalyst for the work.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance and auction on May 30, 2022 17:00 UTC+0. Auction will include unique iron sculpture, unique digital output of render produced by software, codebase, and recorded video of live streamed performance, sent within seven days after live performance.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúEvery Icon: BlockPrint‚Äù by John F. Simon Jr. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Every Icon: BlockPrint&lt;br/&gt;
Since 1996, each iteration of John F. Simon Jr.‚Äôs Every Icon series has been, at its core, a 32 x 32 grid on a digital screen, divided into 1024 squares, each representing a single pixel. But unlike prior versions, ‚ÄúEvery Icon: BlockPrint‚Äù does not have the goal of moving through every computational variation, pixel by pixel, until the grid transforms into a black square. Instead, the artwork introduces variables related to chance and mediated human intervention that can only reflect a concentrated moment in space and time.&lt;br/&gt;
Participants are each assigned ten of 1000 available pixels which they can turn either on or off in the span of 30 minutes. Once the clock stops, the grid will freeze. Whether the result is a distinguishable image or an abstract blotch, Simon will proceed to create a traditional woodblock print on fine art paper with oil-based matte black ink, mirroring the born-digital outcome.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance and auction on May 31, 2022 20:00 UTC+0. Auction will include unique woodblock print on paper, digital still image of final configuration, and recorded live streamed performance.&lt;br/&gt;
Rewilded Topography #1&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúRewilded Topography #1‚Äù is a tabletop sculpture designed as a dynamic, organic urban landscape. The artist created it in response to an increase in artworks inspired by simulated characteristics or near replicas of nature portrayed on a digital screen.&lt;br/&gt;
A type of Stockholm Syndrome has emerged in the form of a greater comfort with confinement. With increasing interest in digital portals leading to the supposed ‚Äúmetaverse,‚Äù there is a growing disregard for the natural universe taking hold, contributing to the acceleration of human demise. Proxies for nature may distract from the urgency around the human species impending extinction. Yet anecdotal and neurobiological findings have made it clear to Lin that identifying oneself with and immersion within the natural world is essential to survival.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance and auction on June 1, 2022 17:00 UTC+0. During the livestream, chosen participants will be invited to enter a date which in turn provokes a set of predetermined actions performed in the landscape, leading into a final performance by the artist. Auction will include unique video of Wiena Lin‚Äôs performance and recorded video of live streamed performance, sent within seven days after live performance.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe Interfered Microscopy Plot‚Äù by Golan Levin. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
The Interfered Microscopy Plot&lt;br/&gt;
Golan Levin‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Interfered Microscopy Plot‚Äù reimagines everyday objects as pareidolic landscapes, producing pen-and-ink drawings in a cybernetic process that melds micro vision, computer vision, and human interference. In Levin‚Äôs performance, the live feed of a digital microscope spurs the machine hallucinations of a semiautonomous drawing algorithm, whose interpretations are both coaxed and culled by the artist. Amid Levin‚Äôs interventions, the system‚Äôs digital forms are returned to the macroscopic physical world through the raucous twittering of a relic plotting machine. Extending from his audiovisual performance ‚ÄúScribble‚Äù (2000), ‚ÄúThe Interfered Microscopy Plot‚Äù continues a thread of Levin‚Äôs software arts research that complicates gestural drawing through abstraction, computation, and real-time interaction.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance and auction on June 2, 2022 17:00 UTC+0. Auction will include a unique work on paper, exhibition copy of recorded video of live streamed performance, and archival file of live streamed performance, sent within seven days after live performance.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMovie on 06-03-22 at 1.00 PM‚Äù by Molly Soda. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Movie on 06-03-22 at 1.00 PM&lt;br/&gt;
Since 2010, Molly Soda has captured audiences by frequently taking videos on the MacOS application Photo Booth with her computer‚Äôs webcam, documenting the mundanity of herself eating, dancing, singing, crying, or talking on the phone. Although many of these moments have been uploaded by the artist to YouTube, for every moment uploaded, there are countless recordings that exist unseen in her archive. Soda recognizes that digital media lends itself to the process of remixing ‚Äî once uploaded to the internet, a video can be saved, re-ordered, stitched, paused, rewound, skipped, and chopped. This realization has led to a longstanding interest from the artist in publicly realizing and facilitating these processes. For ‚ÄúMovie on 06-03-22 at 1.00 PM,‚Äù instead of simply reworking and remixing her own archive for public view, Soda will hand-off hundreds of clips from the last decade over to participants. From the given audiovisual material, 100 viewers will have the ability to collectively create a new Molly Soda video, revealed at the culmination of the live stream.&lt;br/&gt;
Performance and Auction on June 3rd, 2022 17:00 UTC+0. Auction will include unique video created by participants and recorded live streamed performance, sent within seven business days of live performance.&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce g√§mma, an exhibition of 33 unique artworks by generative artist p1xelfool, the gallery‚Äôs first exhibition minted on Tezos.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator kerry doran on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPixels are the smallest element that can be displayed on a digital screen, groupings of which comprise the billions of still and moving images in circulation today. Pixels are not dissimilar to gamma rays, the shortest yet most powerful of the rays in the electromagnetic spectrum. The difference between them would seem to do with perception: gamma rays are invisible, pixels are not. However, both require specifically designed environments to engender visibility, such as a scintillation detector or a computer with a digital display. Because of the relative ubiquity of the latter, the specificity ‚Äî and necessity ‚Äî of the computer environment may be easily overlooked, if not forgotten, when perceiving pixels. The seduction of the screen, with its pixel-based representations, obfuscates the fusion of software and hardware that illuminate content: code and cold cathode. As p1xelfool says, ‚ÄòCode = light.‚Äô&lt;br/&gt;
In g√§mma, p1xelfool fuses pixels with light, with code. With such an emphasis on these materials and their visual properties, the works may seem formalist. Indeed, the generative compositions are strikingly geometric and inorganic; for those familiar with p1xelfool‚Äôs larger body of work, those in g√§mma may come across as austere in comparison. Yet these works are deeper than their surface. p1xelfool‚Äôs approach is intent on reconnecting color and light with the computer environment to create engrossing sensorial experiences specific to it.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú0 + 0 * 11‚Äù by p1xelfool. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
The 33 unique artworks presented in g√§mma are self-contained systems; each contains 3 seeds generated by the system, selected and arranged by the artist to comprise the final composition.&lt;br/&gt;
p1xelfool conceptualized these works with Processing, its visual and responsive coding environment feeling more expressive to the artist than analog painting. The works are executed with p5.js, which allowed p1xelfool to program pixels in the browser in real-time. ‚ÄúInstead of asking the program to draw lines, I asked it to manipulate the pixel arrays,‚Äù he describes. This underscores the conceptual motivation of the project, namely, the reappropriation of pixels (and light and code) rather than the visuals produced by them. When viewing the work, there is the option to hit the ‚ÄúP‚Äù key to pause the pattern; hitting the ‚ÄúS‚Äù key will save and download the frame.&lt;br/&gt;
p1xelfool‚Äôs generative animations are inspired by the logic of particle systems, yet they share no reference to the natural world. The visual environments of the works are specific only to the computer. In each work, two superimposed and interrelated systems simultaneously interact with one another. Their interrelated velocities determine the speed at which blocks of interplaying (and playful) color seem to descend to the bottom of the screen, cycling through new patterns and creating the illusion of endlessness. Colors and patterns are rhythmic and vibrational; visual pleasure is immense and infinite.&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>Feral File Discord Community Updates</description>
      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|*&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File Discord Community Updates&lt;br/&gt;
To welcome 2023, we‚Äôre introducing new changes to&lt;br/&gt;
our community Discord server&lt;br/&gt;
to create a more enjoyable experience for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;
1) Moving from Chat-focus to Forum Threads&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File operates at a different pace. We open a couple of exhibitions per month, so we don‚Äôt expect our community to be around on the server at all times every day. Thus, we felt that allowing long term, gradual conversation to develop would create a friendly environment for new and current community members. We hope that forums allow for deeper exploration of our exhibitions and art-related topics brought up by our community.&lt;br/&gt;
Through each exhibition thread (example:&lt;br/&gt;
https://discord.com/channels/768706944097058828/1058101057332461669&lt;br/&gt;
) and our exhibition list (&lt;br/&gt;
https://discord.com/channels/768706944097058828/1050133565142208542&lt;br/&gt;
), you will quickly find information around the exhibitions and how to keep conversations going with our artists, curators, and other community members.&lt;br/&gt;
If you do want to simply hang out and chat, welcome new members, discuss random things, we welcome this in live-chat and collector-talk.&lt;br/&gt;
2) Technical Support is no longer handled on Discord&lt;br/&gt;
We enjoy discussing the development of Feral File and Autonomy Digital Wallet App on Discord with you, but individual technical support should be handled securely and privately in-app or through mail. This request relates to‚Ä¶&lt;br/&gt;
3) Changes to keep you safe&lt;br/&gt;
We are using various server rules to discourage non-serious users from joining the community. We want you to be safe and highly discourage communicating over DMs, including with us - in the past users have tried to emulate Bitmark employees. We believe these changes will foster a safe place for everyone to discuss art together. Web3 was built on the foundations of transparency, and we similarly echo this in our products. When in doubt, communicate publicly.&lt;br/&gt;
We always welcome feedback and will keep listening to make this a wonderful space for everyone.&lt;br/&gt;

      <title>Feral File‚Äôs Ethereum Bridge has been Launched!</title>
      <link>https://feralfile.substack.com</link>
      <guid>feralfile-7924625_feral-file-s-ethereum-bridge-has-been-launched-.html</guid>

      <description>Feral File‚Äôs Ethereum Bridge has been Launched!</description>
      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[https://feralfile.com&lt;br/&gt;
I am excited to announce the launch of Feral File‚Äôs Ethereum bridge. It allows you to migrate a Feral File NFT from the Bitmark blockchain to Ethereum. You can then control the resulting NFT with an Etherem wallet of your choice or list it on marketplaces like OpenSea.&lt;br/&gt;
You can access this now if you have an edition from&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water&lt;br/&gt;
in your collection. (see the screenshot below for how to find the feature). You will need to pay a one-time Ethereum network fee to migrate. Feral File does not profit from this.&lt;br/&gt;
We will initially add support for one exhibition per week, working backwards to our first exhibition,&lt;br/&gt;
Social Codes&lt;br/&gt;
. We should be able to go faster in a few weeks, and you can expect us to finish before the end of the year. For the technical details, we have updated our&lt;br/&gt;
documentation&lt;br/&gt;
to reflect our latest flows, contracts, data, and metadata.&lt;br/&gt;
You can leave us feedback through our #features channel in the Platform section of our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord.&lt;br/&gt;
Next: Highest-Bidder and Group Auctions&lt;br/&gt;
In my daily work, I focus on making Feral File more accessible. To help collectors, I work with our team to make it easier for anyone (regardless of crypto expertise) to participate in our openings, to enjoy the artists and the artworks being exhibited, and to know what‚Äôs going on.&lt;br/&gt;
We are working on ways of collecting that remove the time pressure many of you feel during openings, and give us more information about how future exhibitions should be editioned. You will see these starting with our next show in November.&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Highest-Bidder Auctions&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äù will be deployed for a single edition or set. These auctions probably work exactly as you think. You will have a set time period to place a bid; a new winning bid within the last 5 minutes extends the auction by 10 minutes. The highest bidder at the end of the auction wins.&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Group Auctions&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äù allow Feral File to sell editions in a way where the price is determined by community consensus. Here‚Äôs an example of how it works:&lt;br/&gt;
Let‚Äôs say 100 editions of an artwork are being auctioned together at a minimum price of $75/USDC.&lt;br/&gt;
The 100 highest bids will win the auction and those collectors are guaranteed an edition. However, each collector only pays the price of the lowest winning bid. To participate:&lt;br/&gt;
1) Make a bid before the auction ends. There is no maximum bid. No information about other bids will be released during the auction.&lt;br/&gt;
2) You may prioritize your bid for one edition number. Assuming you have one of the top 100 bids and you are also the highest bidder for that specific edition number, you get that edition. Otherwise, you will be assigned the lowest numbered edition available after higher bids have been assigned editions.&lt;br/&gt;
Crypto and credit cards will be accepted for both auction types.&lt;br/&gt;
Our goal in implementing these auctions is to give everyone the same opportunity to collect artwork editions. Over time, we will also use the community‚Äôs bidding data to understand how to adjust edition numbers to keep pricing accessible for a wide range of collectors.&lt;br/&gt;
If you would like to test out the user interface to make sure we‚Äôre making the bidding process as smooth as possible, you can join the tests through our #features channel in the Platform section of our&lt;br/&gt;

Opening on Feral File on April 20th, BLOOMCORE is an exhibition of a new series by Rick Silva, curated by Claire L. Evans.&lt;br/&gt;
Last year, Silva 3D-scanned hundreds of blooming plants throughout the Pacific Northwest, which he later grafted and pruned into a hyper-flora. In 30-second looping videos, eerie vegetal forms rotate and slice through a fog of atmospheric lights. The series, also titled BLOOMCORE, will be available in&lt;br/&gt;
a series of 55 artworks&lt;br/&gt;
, each priced at .25 ETH.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;
April 20, 2023&lt;br/&gt;
14:00 UTC+0 (7am Los Angeles, 11am S√£o Paulo, 3pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting begins one hour later&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Claire L. Evans on BLOOMCORE:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúIn Silva‚Äôs BLOOMCORE, we encounter beings familiar, yet unknown, and unknowable. Lush rhododendrons, broad-leaved ferns, rare roses, denizens of deep forests: scanned in the spring of 2022, they are each presented in full bloom, at the height of their lives and thus also on the brink of death. As I write these words, most of the real-life plants Silva has volumetrically captured are almost certainly dead, but they‚Äôll remain preserved in perpetuity, on the blockchain, like museum specimens. To me this is profoundly gothic ‚Äî these blooms hanging outside of time in the radiant computational darkness, promising transcendence, concealing poison (Silva has even included a few poisonous pitcher plants in this collection, vegetal carnivores with alluring, vaselike forms). In this he summons the vast dreaming life of plants, their hidden, distributed way of knowing, their collective ancientness, and the slow, halting way they move across the world.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Rick Silva:&lt;br/&gt;
Rick Silva is a Brazilian-American artist whose videos, websites, and installations explore virtuality, futurology, and speculative ecologies. His work has been exhibited at institutions including The Centre Pompidou, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, and The Whitney Museum of American Art. He has been featured in Artforum, Wired, and Rhizome‚Äôs NET ART Anthology. He lives in Eugene, Oregon where he is an Associate Professor at The University of Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Selected Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúBLOOMCORE‚Äù by Rick Silva. Images courtesy of Feral File and the artist.&lt;br/&gt;
In the spring and summer of 2022, artist Rick Silva 3D-scanned living plants throughout the Pacific Northwest ‚Äî in university greenhouses, coastal redwoods, the high desert, and the Cascade mountains. Following this field work, Silva grafted and pruned the digitized plants into an eternal hyper-flora that rotates and slices through a fog of atmospheric lights. His eerie vegetal forms hover at the edges of representation and abstraction, digital and organic, familiar and alien.&lt;br/&gt;

from¬†I Know, an exhibition exploring what an aesthetic of truth might be, are now available for sale. Curated by Giorgio Vitale, I Know features an intergenerational group of five artists, each embracing very different aesthetics and artistic strategies. Their works in the show address anxieties about the turmoil we are now experiencing around the world and offer critical reflections on it.&lt;br/&gt;

THIRD I KNOW TWITTER SPACE&lt;br/&gt;
with Yehwan Song and AES+F&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Giorgio Vitale on I Know:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe ‚Äòtruth‚Äô considered in this exhibition is not a scientific or academic one, but rather an imaginative one. It is based on the slow unfolding that viewers experience when they sit with an artwork. In our current post-truth society, in which veracity and accuracy are sacrificed on the altar of hyperbole and misinformation, I Know invites artists to reexamine historical moments and to evoke images of the past in order to claim a place within it. These artists struggle with power, inequality, and discrimination, addressing debates about mass surveillance and the architecture of the web3. The works in the exhibition reflect on traditional modes of thinking, both inside of and outside of the arts, and in so doing make way for future possibilities.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>Improvements to the Collecting Experience</description>
      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[https://feralfile.com&lt;br/&gt;
Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;
I have several Feral File changes to announce.&lt;br/&gt;
Starting with the next exhibition,&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water&lt;br/&gt;
, (more below) you will have a new way to buy editions: similar to sets, you will be able to simply buy the lowest numbered edition of an artwork available with one click when an exhibition opens for sale. If you would like, you can still manually look for a preferred edition number, but we believe that this option will make the collecting experience more enjoyable for many in our community.&lt;br/&gt;
In addition, we have also:&lt;br/&gt;
made enhancements to the website speed to avoid slowdowns in peak traffic situations like exhibition openings.&lt;br/&gt;
implemented multi-currency display. Now you can see prices in USD/USDC, ETH, or BTC.&lt;br/&gt;
2 Minute Request: Help us learn about your experience with NFTs&lt;br/&gt;
As part of our work in developing better collecting experiences with Feral File and Autonomy, I‚Äôd love to learn more about your experience with NFTs.&lt;br/&gt;
Could you help me by completing this two minute survey? Your personal information will not be shared with us.&lt;br/&gt;
Start here:&lt;br/&gt;
https://forms.gle/QQHjwBQGVdnW8fjf8&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water&lt;br/&gt;
Our next exhibition,&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water&lt;br/&gt;
, will open on&lt;br/&gt;
October 6, 2021 15:00 UTC+0 (11pm Shanghai, 5pm Berlin, 12pm S√£o Paulo, 8am Los Angeles)&lt;br/&gt;
, with collecting to begin one hour later.&lt;br/&gt;
Join us on Discord&lt;br/&gt;
to engage with other collectors, the artists, and curator Luba Elliott.&lt;br/&gt;
Each artwork will be released as an edition of 88 (900 editions for sale), with each edition priced at $222 USD. To learn more, see&lt;br/&gt;
our press release&lt;br/&gt;
or read on.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Luba Elliott on Reflections in the Water:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLooking into a still pond, we see a clear, gently blurred version of ourselves staring back at us, while turbulent waters return mere rippled echoes of our shape. These changing reflections of ourselves are similar to images generated from data, which can be hyperrealistic depictions of the original, or images that are surreal and barely recognizable, as flaws and errors creep in.&lt;br/&gt;
Reflections in the Water looks at the way artists represent nature and humans, using the latest machine learning technologies to conjure seascapes, imaginary marine creatures, autumn leaves as well as musing on the human form, its shapes and possibilities. Masks and faces akin to the grotesque rear their heads, reminding us both of the early errors of these technologies and the eternal human fascination with depicting ourselves. These artists present AI as a tool to both craft new reflections on perennial subject matters as well as a creative partner, conjuring new landscapes, creatures, and human forms.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Announcing N=12, a collaboratively created group exhibition of generative artists, and the launch of Feral File 2.0&lt;br/&gt;

N=12&lt;br/&gt;
is¬†a group exhibition that arose out of a dialogue between twelve artists across seven¬†time zones. Selected through a democratic process from the&lt;br/&gt;
Generative Artists Club (genartclub)&lt;br/&gt;
, these artists have had direct and active conversations with one another for months, sharing their code and artistic processes to generate artworks that give testament to the power of collaboration in a networked world.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Aaron Penne on&lt;br/&gt;
N=12&lt;br/&gt;
and the unique process behind the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThis cross-pollination of ideas pushed each of the artists towards new technical and aesthetic innovations. Each of their works is created with code written by the artists themselves. This has required artists to be equally comfortable ideating with infinite imagination and instructing a machine to translate these ideas into reality. The&lt;br/&gt;
Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.)&lt;br/&gt;
of the 1960s normalized the collaboration of artists and engineers. In contrast, the artists of this show ‚Äî indeed, much of this generation ‚Äî are themselves all hybrid artist-engineers. Not only do they critique each other‚Äôs aesthetics, they also debug each other‚Äôs code. In such a context, variables, functions, and logic are as open to influence as color palette. These artists are not just sharing outputs with each other, they are sharing their innermost processes.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

FEMMEBIT&lt;br/&gt;
is a grassroots platform and triennial festival of Los Angeles-based artists working in video and new media. As a celebration that includes curated programs, symposiums, screenings and exhibitions, FEMMEBIT examines today‚Äôs society at large as an ever-changing medium. This platform investigates how artists working with and between technologies enables progressive ideas to be born through active creation, and how we, as proponents of these fields, must work together to shape, share, and grow a future receptive to progress.&lt;br/&gt;

What&amp;#x27;s new in Feral File 2.0&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File Co-Founder Casey Reas and Bitmark CEO, Sean Moss-Pultz, share¬†their vision for the next iteration of Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
FF 2.0 presents¬†a new model to experience and collect exhibitions and a totally refreshed¬†look. It marks a return to our core values by doubling down on what makes Feral File unique in the on-chain art space:&lt;br/&gt;
Group exhibitions:&lt;br/&gt;
Artists on Feral File collaborate with a curator to create and exhibit artworks around a single, ambitious theme.&lt;br/&gt;
Works as series:&lt;br/&gt;
Each artist in an exhibition creates work as a series. A series contains multiple unique artworks connected together under a single series theme. Each series in an exhibition has the same number of artworks in it.&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting in sets:&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibitions are collected in sets that comprise one artwork from each series in an exhibition. Individual artworks are not offered for primary sale. Each set is unique, capturing a different facet of an exhibition‚Äôs full curatorial vision.&lt;br/&gt;
Multichain and fully web3:&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File 2.0 supports exhibitions on either Ethereum or Tezos and is fully compatible with current web3 standards.&lt;br/&gt;
Commitment to artist royalties:&lt;br/&gt;
Royalties are now streamed directly to artists, and all precautions are taken to guarantee royalties collection on secondary markets.&lt;br/&gt;
Public documentation:&lt;br/&gt;
Much more attention is given to documenting, presenting, and preservation the events and other cultural production surrounding exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;

Forthcoming from Feral File, we have an exciting exhibition opening&lt;br/&gt;

In Medias Res&lt;br/&gt;
Featuring Petra Cortright, JJ Stratford, Anna Luisa Petrisko, Casey Kauffmann, Ellie Pritts, Wednesday Kim, Eve-Lauryn LaFountain, Tuna Bora, and Huntress Janos. Curated by Kate Parsons and Janna Avner of FEMMEBIT.&lt;br/&gt;
In Medias Res&lt;br/&gt;
is an exhibition of on-chain art by Los Angeles-adjacent, feminist, and post-cyberfeminist artists. Their works reflect today‚Äôs digital uprootedness from time-based narratives of the silver screen to invoke liminal spaces of belonging.&lt;br/&gt;
FEMMEBIT&lt;br/&gt;
is a grassroots platform and triennial festival of Los Angeles-based artists working in video and new media. Since 2016, the group has showcased the distinctive voices and perspectives of female and non-binary artists, offering ‚Äúa unique, unapologetically feminist perspective on the futuristic zeitgeist.‚Äù (&lt;br/&gt;

Curators Kate Parsons and Janna Avner on&lt;br/&gt;
In Medias Res&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe exhibition takes its name from the narrative device, defined as ‚Äòinto the midst of things.‚Äô As this might suggest, the nine artists in the exhibition invite us to engage directly with the heart of their stories, wherein they explore their personal relationships to Los Angeles as they negotiate daily life in relation to Hollywood and the broader SoCal area.&lt;br/&gt;
The title is also a comment on the nature of NFTs themselves ‚Äî media without a beginning, middle, or end. As still or looping moving images, NFTs have a strange relationship to time, often depicting states of emergence as powerful vignettes. In this sense, NFTs might be considered ‚Äòin the midst of things,‚Äô post-time and post-narrative, especially in contrast to the conventions of Hollywood storytelling.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;

In/Visible, a group show of 10 Black artists exploring AI, opens Monday&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe Idunnos, #45‚Äù by Jah.&lt;br/&gt;
On Monday, June 12 at 14:00 UTC, we‚Äôre opening&lt;br/&gt;
In/Visible&lt;br/&gt;
, a landmark exhibition of ten artists exploring AI as a means to be known and seen, to tell their stories, and to hold space for humanity. Curated by&lt;br/&gt;
Linda Dounia Rebeiz&lt;br/&gt;
, In/Visible presents new work by&lt;br/&gt;
Adaeze Okaro, Afroscope, Arclight, Jah, Linda Dounia, Minne Atairu, Nygilia, Rayan Elnayal, Serwah, and Zoe Osborne&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition looks at AI as a tool of exclusion, and, as Linda Dounia Rebeiz puts it in their curator‚Äôs note, ‚Äúbrings together artists who are defiantly visible, telling their stories using AI, a tool that, itself, acknowledges its shortcomings in understanding them.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
In/Visible has been generating a lot of pre-exhibition excitement, including a&lt;br/&gt;
Hypebae feature&lt;br/&gt;
üôÇ&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Don&amp;#x27;t miss this release ‚Äî I bet this will be one art historians will talk about decades from now‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†‚Äî&lt;br/&gt;
Phillip Gara&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú!!!!‚Äù ‚Äî&lt;br/&gt;
Tina Rivers Ryan&lt;br/&gt;
And here‚Äôs a few of the artists in the exhibition, describing their works in their own words:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPlanet Hibiscus, #5‚Äù by Adaeze Okaro.&lt;br/&gt;
On their work ‚ÄúPlanet Hibiscus,‚Äù artist&lt;br/&gt;
Adaeze Okaro&lt;br/&gt;
writes that, ‚Äúwith the help of Midjourney, I imagined being sent as a photographer to document the coronation and wedding of the fictitious Planet Hibiscus‚Äô new monarch and her partner. I imagined shooting the experience on a medium-format film camera.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúConfetti, #7‚Äù by Nygilia.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúI see life through vibrations,‚Äù writes&lt;br/&gt;
Nyglia&lt;br/&gt;
, on the experimental work ‚ÄúConfetti,‚Äù which embraces a disco aesthetic and dancehall immersion. ‚ÄúA summer‚Äôs night of dance, shining brighter with each camera flare. To feel the world is to believe in balance. There is no perfect memory. Only beautiful thoughts.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Jah&lt;br/&gt;
, whose piece ‚ÄúThe Idunnos‚Äù is pictured above, explains that the work depicts ‚Äúbeings that reside in between the nexus of everything and nothing. They stand as gatekeepers in the liminal space where light meets darkness, where silence meets sound, where the known and the unknown converge.‚Äù If you‚Äôre unfamiliar with Jah‚Äôs work, be sure to read&lt;br/&gt;
this Twitter thread&lt;br/&gt;
, by way of introduction.&lt;br/&gt;
The works in In/Visible are minted on&lt;br/&gt;
Ethereum.&lt;br/&gt;
Update on pricing:&lt;br/&gt;
For&lt;br/&gt;
24 hours after collecting starts, artworks will be sold in sets for 0.55 ETH per set&lt;br/&gt;
. When you purchase a set, you receive an edition of each of the 10 artworks in the show.&lt;br/&gt;
After 24 hours, each artwork edition will be available for purchase individually, for 0.055 ETH per edition&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition is&lt;br/&gt;
opening on&lt;br/&gt;
June 12 at 14:00 UTC&lt;br/&gt;
(7am Los Angeles, 11am S√£o Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai), with&lt;br/&gt;

Meanwhile, we‚Äôre busy putting together two exhibitions that get at the very heart of Feral File‚Äôs work over the last years and feature an unreal number of the artists we most admire. It‚Äôs extremely exciting and hard not to talk about, but‚Ä¶ more on that soon.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúUnsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA‚Äù,&lt;br/&gt;
Refik Anadol&lt;br/&gt;
During the weekend of May 19‚Äì21, we hosted a burn event for Refik Anadol‚Äôs&lt;br/&gt;
Unsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA&lt;br/&gt;
artwork. The work is a global AI data painting that simulates a latent walk among the Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs digitized collection and was minted as an edition of 5,000 as part of Refik‚Äôs&lt;br/&gt;
Unsupervised exhibition&lt;br/&gt;
on November 18, 2021.&lt;br/&gt;
The goal of the burn was to reduce the total supply of the artwork and reward Refik‚Äôs most loyal collectors. Collectors could opt to burn either 3, 6, or 9 editions of the work in exchange for 3 different reward tiers. Each tier featured a new digital artwork, a new physical work, and a day pass to the MoMA. The burn was a great success, reducing the total supply by 32.4%. All one hundred Tier 3 collections sold out, and 65 Tier 2 and 110 Tier 1 collections were redeemed.&lt;br/&gt;
Our team worked hard to bring this project to life, and we are thrilled with the outcome. Thanks to everyone at Refik Anadol Studio and MoMA who supported the project along the way!&lt;br/&gt;
And finally, we have some exciting news coming soon! All we‚Äôll say now is keep a look out for Feral File 2.0, which will include a new exhibition program,¬†a new way to collect works, and a totally refreshed look&lt;br/&gt;

Kim Asendorf‚Äôs new exhibition COLORS OF NOISE is coming soon to Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
Join the Discord Conversation&lt;br/&gt;
Mark your calendars for our next exhibition, COLORS OF NOISE, showing new work by German visual artist Kim Asendorf.&lt;br/&gt;
For over a decade, the pixel has been the main building block in Asendorf&amp;#x27;s work, seemingly alive in his abstractions or rearranged in his iconic Pixel Sorting aesthetics.&lt;br/&gt;
For COLORS OF NOISE, curated by Peggy Schoenegge and opening on May 18, Asendorf has developed an algorithm that generates intricate and dynamic patterns of color-based noises, such as pink noise, brown noise, and white noise. These colored noises are visualized in a flickering mesh of lines, creating a moir√© pattern ‚Äî¬†different sounds have different effects, and the listener is directly drawn into the audio-visual experience, immersing into a multisensory artwork.&lt;br/&gt;
COLORS OF NOISE is a series of 50 unique artworks minted on Ethereum, 47 of which will be on sale for 0.25 ETH.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;
May 18, 2023 14:00 UTC+0&lt;br/&gt;
(7am Los Angeles, 11am S√£o Paulo, 4pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;

Kim Asendorf is a German visual artist who works with conceptual strategies and generative systems to create abstract animations, images and sculptures. His abstract visual systems are conceptually set and realized in algorithms that are open to a wide range of interpretations. He works on a per-pixel level to create worlds that mix simplicity with complexity, that never sleep, and that can put the viewer in a mesmerizing state. He loves to experiment, is driven by curiosity, and finds satisfaction when the results of his work surprise himself. With roots in Net Art, he likes to keep his work easily accessible, and the Internet is his favorite canvas.&lt;br/&gt;
Asendorf also directed the music video for Metallica‚Äôs new song ‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Chasing Light&lt;br/&gt;
,‚Äù which premiered on April 19, 2023 and featured his work in the background.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Peggy Schoenegge on COLORS OF NOISE:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúCOLORS OF NOISE lies at the intersection of art and technology, combining Asendorf‚Äôs artistic practice with new technologies and physical laws. Drawing upon his expertise in programming, the artist has developed an algorithm that generates intricate and dynamic patterns of color-based noises. The algorithm processes these noises by shaping different frequencies, creating different properties of different colors. Their sonic qualities are translated into an artistic display of vibrant meshes of lines that evolve and transform with the changing soundscape. By transforming the immaterial sound waves into pixelated lines in black and white, an abstract flickering image appears that forms a moir√© pattern. It becomes an extension of the sonic experience. The network of lines visualizes the audio, emphasizing its characteristics and materializing the colored noise of the sound.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Artificial evolution is a powerful process for creating moving images.&lt;br/&gt;
To initiate such a process, Driessens &amp;amp; Verstappen designed algorithms that mimic genetic evolution so that their visualizations can be &amp;quot;grown&amp;quot; rather than hand-coded. Each artwork commences with a unique formula that determines the value of each pixel from black to white. These basic mathematical operators invoke a process of variation and selection, so that each new generation of formulae becomes a window into a deeper, multi-dimensional field.&lt;br/&gt;

If all sets are not sold in the first 30 minutes, remaining sets are sold at the base price for the next 23.5 hours. After this (24 hours from the start of the sale), any remaining sets are removed from sale at Feral File entirely.&lt;br/&gt;

Introducing¬†Feral File 2.0&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File Co-Founder Casey Reas and Bitmark CEO, Sean Moss-Pultz, share¬†their vision for the next iteration of Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
N=12&lt;br/&gt;
is the first exhibition in the new Feral File 2.0, which represents a major rework of our exhibition program. FF 2.0 presents¬†a new model to experience and collect exhibitions and a totally refreshed¬†look.It marks a return to our core values by doubling down on what makes Feral File unique in the on-chain art space:&lt;br/&gt;
Group exhibitions:&lt;br/&gt;
Artists on Feral File collaborate with a curator to create and exhibit artworks around a single, ambitious theme.&lt;br/&gt;
Works as series:&lt;br/&gt;
Each artist in an exhibition creates work as a series. A series contains multiple unique artworks connected together under a single series theme. Each series in an exhibition has the same number of artworks in it.&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting in sets:&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibitions are collected in sets that comprise one artwork from each series in an exhibition. Individual artworks are not offered for primary sale. Each set is unique, capturing a different facet of an exhibition‚Äôs full curatorial vision.&lt;br/&gt;
Multichain and fully web3:&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File 2.0 supports exhibitions on either Ethereum or Tezos and is fully compatible with current web3 standards.&lt;br/&gt;
Continued commitment to artist royalties:&lt;br/&gt;
Royalties are now streamed directly to artists, and additional¬†precautions have been taken to guarantee royalties on secondary markets.&lt;br/&gt;
Public documentation:&lt;br/&gt;
Much more attention is given to documenting, presenting, and preservation the events and other cultural production surrounding exhibitions.&lt;br/&gt;

How Feral File Artworks are now Shown on OpenSea&lt;br/&gt;
Back in December&lt;br/&gt;
, I asked for your feedback on how Feral File was doing. While the feedback was (thankfully) overwhelmingly positive, we learned that we could improve our listings on OpenSea. It took some work to find the right contact at OpenSea and a lot of waiting as they worked through their backlog, but the integration is now complete. (You can read more about how Feral File editions can be migrated to Ethereum&lt;br/&gt;
in our FAQ&lt;br/&gt;
)&lt;br/&gt;
As an example, let‚Äôs look at&lt;br/&gt;
an artwork from Refik Anadol&lt;br/&gt;
. On OpenSea, you can now view an edition‚Äôs key information within the title. Search support for this information hasn‚Äôt been fully updated on the OpenSea side, but we‚Äôll continue to monitor and communicate with them to get this fully working. We‚Äôll also look to iterate upon these improvements with your feedback. To learn more about the specifics of the metadata formatting, see&lt;br/&gt;
our HackMD documentation&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Win an Artwork&lt;br/&gt;
Help us in order to win a hand-picked artwork from Feral File co-creator Casey Reas.&lt;br/&gt;
We‚Äôre asking for help in two areas: 1) Help us find great people to make your Feral File experience better 2) Help us make your Autonomy experience better.&lt;br/&gt;
First, thanks to your support over the last year, we‚Äôre now in a position to build out the team. If you refer me to someone we end up hiring, Casey Reas will handpick an artwork edition for you! To follow up with me, send me an email at&lt;br/&gt;
michael@bitmark.com&lt;br/&gt;
. Include why you think I should consider this person, as well as their contact information. Think of your referral as their cover letter. We‚Äôre hiring for the following roles, all of which can be done from any location.&lt;br/&gt;
Business Development&lt;br/&gt;
Community Organizer and Program Curator ‚Äì Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
Design Lead&lt;br/&gt;
(2x)&lt;br/&gt;
Gallery Director ‚Äì Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
Growth Lead ‚Äì Autonomy&lt;br/&gt;
Product Manager ‚Äì Autonomy&lt;br/&gt;
Software Engineer&lt;br/&gt;
(3x)&lt;br/&gt;
Second, many of you are using our Autonomy app to view your NFT collections from the Ethereum, Bitmark (Feral File), and Tezos blockchains. I thank you because I know the app experience is still a bit rough in parts.&lt;br/&gt;
This is where we need help: help us find bugs! We will pay $20 into your Wyre wallet on Feral File if you can make Autonomy crash, $10 if you find incorrect data, and $5 for UI bugs. You‚Äôll also be entered in a drawing to win a Feral File (also handpicked by Casey) artwork in May. The bounty reward and drawing entry are given per each unique bug discovered. If multiple people submit the same bug, whoever submitted it first gets the bounty.&lt;br/&gt;
To receive your reward, message us in the autonomy-app channel on our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord server&lt;br/&gt;
or email&lt;br/&gt;
support@bitmark.com&lt;br/&gt;
. Include the steps we‚Äôll need to follow to replicate the bug, as well as your Feral File alias. Please note that this is only for new bugs ‚Äî you can check against our known issues on&lt;br/&gt;
Github&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
As a reminder, you can find Autonomy on&lt;br/&gt;
iPhone&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Android&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Web3 Wallet and other Enhancements&lt;br/&gt;
In 2022, we have been working hard on making Feral File even easier to use. For example, find these in&lt;br/&gt;
your account page&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;br/&gt;
1) You can choose how you want to sign in to your account and authorize transactions - Email or Web3 wallet (ex. Metamask, Autonomy)&lt;br/&gt;
2) Coming this weekend: You can export a complete history of your Feral File transactions for personal archival or accounting purposes.&lt;br/&gt;
3) You can change your username at any time through the ‚ÄúAlias‚Äù at the top left of your account page.&lt;br/&gt;
We will also be rolling out enhancements to our next group auction to make the bidding process more transparent and enjoyable. These new changes are based on collector feedback and our own internal observations, so thank you to everyone who contributed to making it better.&lt;br/&gt;
Our Ethics&lt;br/&gt;
Last year, we saw an instance in which an NFT platform was accused of allowing insider trading. From this, we realized we needed to develop our own policy to make sure that everyone on our team understood the problem and to make a public commitment to enforce these ethics for the long-term development of the Feral File community. This was the result, as linked from the Feral File footer:&lt;br/&gt;
Employee Participation in Feral File Sales&lt;br/&gt;
No set of guidelines can account for every scenario. From these principles, Bitmark employees may not use their knowledge or private access to guide their or others‚Äô purchasing decisions on Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In application of these principles, Bitmark employees are prohibited from participating in any sale in which Feral File has an information advantage over the public. This includes both direct and indirect participation such as by funding a third party. For example, in highest bidder auctions, Feral File can view collector deposits and use that information to understand upcoming bids ‚Äî employees cannot participate in these auctions. With fixed price sales, however, Feral File has no special access to purchase before others ‚Äî employees may participate in purchasing.&lt;br/&gt;
Connect with Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to send us feedback on how everything is working for you and how we can do better. In addition to&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
, we‚Äôre also on&lt;br/&gt;
Instagram&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Twitter&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
As always, I appreciate your support. Message me anytime with your questions and thoughts.&lt;br/&gt;

Now Open: BOOM TOWN by Peter Burr&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce BOOM TOWN, new media artist Peter Burr‚Äôs fictional neighborhood built and expanded on the blockchain. Each piece in BOOM TOWN, curated by Julia Kaganskiy, represents a unique, living artwork comprised of 1,000 images that will change over time, evolving as a kind of durational stop-motion animation over an undetermined period pegged to Ethereum‚Äôs block time‚Äîthat is, the length of time it takes to add another block to the blockchain.&lt;br/&gt;
In one hour, 12:00 PM EST, collecting starts with a highest bid auction of a complete set of all eight artworks, including 2 unique (1 of 1) artworks, starting at $3,675. This auction will last two hours. At 2:10¬†PM EST, individual editions will be made available for collecting at fixed prices.&lt;br/&gt;
In total, this exhibition features:&lt;br/&gt;
1 of 1: POWER PLANT ($1,000)&lt;br/&gt;
1 of 1: LUXURY HOME ($1,000)&lt;br/&gt;
3 editions : FACTORY($350)&lt;br/&gt;
3 editions: OFFICE PARK($350)&lt;br/&gt;
3 editions: SHOPPING PLAZA ($350)&lt;br/&gt;
3 editions: WAREHOUSE ($350)&lt;br/&gt;
12 editions: APARTMENT BLOCK ($250)&lt;br/&gt;
Open Edition: EMPTY LOT ($75)&lt;br/&gt;
Please note that any artworks that are sold in the set auction will not be available as individual editions.&lt;br/&gt;
Collectors receive the full set of images as part of their acquisition package and can browse or even create prints of the work‚Äôs past or future state, but they cannot make the work advance any faster or slower than block time. What will reach its end first, the work seems to be asking, the durational performance of BOOM TOWN? Or the technology it‚Äôs powered by? There‚Äôs only one way to find out.&lt;br/&gt;
Please join us on&lt;br/&gt;
Twitter Spaces&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Julia Kaganskiy on BOOM TOWN:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLike most of his works, Peter Burr‚Äôs BOOM TOWN is a richly crafted narrative world that is deeply evocative while remaining mysterious and restrained. Displaying the artist‚Äôs gift for creating images and environments that hover on the boundary between abstraction and figuration, they invite the viewer to fill in the blanks with their own interpretation, suggesting a story that is barely legible yet unmistakably present. Inspired by the tools and aesthetics of video games, Burr‚Äôs compositions draw on generative dynamics and the complexity that emerges from simple, rule-based systems. Each of the eight works in BOOM TOWN follows a precise logic for generating the structure‚Äôs architecture, its ground and field, its shadows, planes, and colors. The resulting images are reminiscent of 8-bit video games and early computer graphics, as well as the flat diagrammatic quality of CAD architectural drawings.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Peter Burr:&lt;br/&gt;
Peter Burr is an artist from Brooklyn, New York. His practice often engages with tools of the video game industry in the form of immersive cinematic artworks. These pieces have been presented internationally by various institutions, including Documenta 14, Athens; MoMA PS1, New York; and The Barbican Centre, London.&lt;br/&gt;
Previously Burr worked under the alias Hooliganship and founded the video label Cartune Xprez through which he produced hundreds of live multimedia exhibitions and touring programs showcasing a multi-generational group of artists at the forefront of experimental animation. His practice has been recognized through grants and awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Creative Capital Grant, and a Sundance New Frontier Fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Every one of the structures in BOOM TOWN represents a unique, living artwork comprised of 1,000 images that will change over time, evolving as a kind of durational stop-motion animation over an undetermined period pegged to Ethereum‚Äôs block time ‚Äî that is, the length of time it takes to add another block to the blockchain. Collectors receive the full set of images as part of their acquisition package and can browse or even create prints of the work‚Äôs past or future state, but they cannot make the work advance any faster or slower than block time.&lt;br/&gt;
Burr‚Äôs process blends traditional animation techniques with the affordances of generative algorithmic systems. Each work originates with ‚Äúintentionally unoptimized algorithms‚Äù developed by Burr‚Äôs collaborator, Dave Tandem, and follows a precise composition logic that dictates its form, ground and field, shadows, planes, colors, and weight. The software allows Burr to draw structures on a gravity-influenced canvas and to animate them changing over time. Burr is interested in highlighting the unique fingerprints of various software and in his practice often works across tech pipelines to weave these diverse fingerprints into a unique aesthetic, reveling in the compression and dithering that occurs through this approach. The final images are outputted into a custom framework built by Tandem that uses block time to advance their evolution.&lt;br/&gt;
APARTMENT BLOCK&lt;br/&gt;

Like a chunk of houses glued together and cut into cubes, each with a standalone reality ‚Äî the apartment blocks aren‚Äôt meant to be good because the community enjoys the process of making them better.&lt;br/&gt;
FACTORY&lt;br/&gt;

We‚Äôll sustain half the town with a small factory.¬† The taller the smokestack, the better we‚Äôll spread our invisible byproducts.&lt;br/&gt;
SHOPPING PLAZA&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSHOPPING PLAZA‚Äù by Peter Burr. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
A good town needs a few places to go when you‚Äôre bored. None of them are here, but the food court has an arcade.&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Christiane Paul on Chain Reaction:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúChain Reaction strives to underscore the inherent connections between the blockchain as a list of data blocks facilitating the recording of transactions and tracking of assets, and the generative social, aesthetic, and environmental contexts and networks in which these assets are embedded. The works in this exhibition explore their existence as ‚Äòtokens‚Äô beyond just being technological records of a transaction: they function as catalysts in precipitating events or actions, from environmental preservation and sustainability of a creative process to aesthetic choices. NFTs are functionally defined by their non-fungible status. They are capable of encapsulating and proving ownership of digital artworks that are often characterized by malleable, generative, untraceable, or imperceptible qualities. The artworks in Chain Reaction highlight the porous boundaries between NFTs as a mechanism for unique identification, on the one hand, and as a common ‚Äòkeepsake‚Äô of a social contract and commitment, or collective action, on the other.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Selected Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;

Public View / Private View by Jennifer and Kevin McCoy&lt;br/&gt;
Jennifer and Kevin McCoy‚Äôs ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù opens up the artistic process of creation ‚Äî usually driven by artists‚Äô concepts and aesthetic choices ‚Äî to a community of donors and art supporters connected to the McCoys. Collectors receive an animated composite of a series of images that are based on pictures submitted to the McCoys by a group of donors of the artists‚Äô work who thereby participated in the NFT‚Äôs creation process. ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù is based on the McCoys‚Äô 2018 project ‚ÄúPublic Key / Private Key‚Äù for which they produced a short 16mm film, donated it to the Whitney Museum‚Äôs Special Collection, then issued 50 Ethereum ERC-721 tokens to represent the right to be named as one of the ‚Äúdonors of record‚Äù for the film and selected 50 donors from an open call for applications. The tokens were allowed to freely circulate for a period of six months. For ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View,‚Äù the McCoys asked these 50 donors of record to submit an image personally meaningful to them and created a coded interpretation of it. The interpretations of the donors‚Äô 50 images were then combined into the animation that collectors can purchase as NFT. The 50 donors receive an ink-on-paper version of the image. While ‚ÄúPublic Key / Private Key‚Äù made the donation process accessible to a wider public, ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù involves the donors in the creation process itself. Using the blockchain as authentication and distribution mechanism, the two projects form a creative chain that not only binds the artists as makers to an expanding community of interested supporters, but makes the nodes along the way a formal part of the work itself. In ‚ÄúPublic View / Private View‚Äù the blockchain anchors the creation, distribution, and archiving process of the artwork.&lt;br/&gt;
Seed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124 by Amelia Winger-Bearskin&lt;br/&gt;
(Image Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Amelia Winger-Bearskin‚Äôs ‚ÄúSeed Protocol - Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time (DLITE) 43:28:22.0004124‚Äù involves collectors in her ongoing artwork inspired by seeds and their caretakers. The NFT edition consists of an image of an identical pile of corn seeds that have been colored by the artist in 100 variations, wrapping the seeds in hand-drawn patterns. As still life, the seed piles imagine what the future seven generations of corn seeds might look like, suggesting textile and beading patterns or more alien mutations. Corn is one of the ‚Äúthree sisters‚Äù (corn, beans, and squash) according to the knowledge of the Haudenausaunee people. (Winger-Bearskin is an enrolled member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation of Oklahoma, which is part of the Haudenosaunee confederacy.) The three sisters are grown together, giving nutrients, shade, and support. The ‚Äúseven generations‚Äù concept reminds us that our current knowledge is built on that of the seven generations before us, and that we must make good decisions for our descendants seven generations in the future.&lt;br/&gt;
Each of the seed pile variations has a unique DLITE (Dynamical Lunar Indigenous Time) number, riffing on the Terrestrial Dynamical Time that NASA uses as a timestamp for celestial voyages.¬†The future that Winger-Bearskin imagines for seeds is inspired in equal parts by several sources: the celestial storytelling of the Seneca-Cayuga; NASA‚Äôs Project Artemis; as well as the work of her colleagues‚Äô Robert Ferl and Anna-Lisa Paul, plant molecular biologists who lead a team focused on growing plants in space at the University of Florida Space Plant Lab.&lt;br/&gt;
Along with the NFT, collectors receive a participation contract and access to the Seed Protocol website, asking¬† them to contribute to the larger seed protocol project. They will receive regular updates on all online and in-person events related to Seed Protocol project 2023-2024. Collectors will also play an active role in shaping the project by agreeing to make contributions: engaging with a local seed bank or heirloom seed society in their area and uploading information about the organization to Amelia Winger-Bearskin‚Äôs Seed Bank Directory or engaging with one of the seed groups with whom the artist is working.&lt;br/&gt;

The Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater by Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow&lt;br/&gt;
Ira Greenberg and Marina Zurkow‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Dorises - Oystercraft from silicon to saltwater‚Äù allows collectors to purchase an oyster, a unique NFT in the digital ocean. While the outsides of the oyster shells are similar, there are categories and variations across the 100 oysters in the edition. The insides are structured through custom generative software according to four categories, each based on an aspect of oyster physiology, purpose, and lore: Oyster Engineer (plumbing, cleaning, sifting, filtering machinery); Oyster Artist (creating beauty, wonder, inspiration, well-being); Oyster Sex Symbol (aphrodisiacal and sex-changing); and Oyster Kin (with humans who ‚Äúfarm‚Äù and eat them). The artists used AI to generate the oyster elements and backgrounds; embedded across the four categories are fifteen unique surprises, with varying degrees of rarity.&lt;br/&gt;
Along with their oyster, collectors receive a unique password that gives them access to the OysterCraftReef website, where they see their NFT come together with the other collected oysters to form a visual reef. As a collective structure, the oyster reef supports real-world projects such as oyster reef cultivation, conservation, and awareness work. After no more than 90 days after the birth of the reef, collectors will vote on distributing the funds generated through their purchase to three different groups supporting oyster reef conservation, which has been identified by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as a priority. The project title, ‚ÄúThe Dorises,‚Äù alludes to Doris, a sea goddess in Greek mythology. Doris was one of the 3000 Oceanids, daughters of the Titans Oceanus and Tethys, and represents the fertility of the ocean. Her name connects the two words¬†D√¥ron, meaning ‚Äúgift‚Äù or ‚Äúabundance,‚Äù and¬†Z√¥ros, meaning the ‚Äúpure‚Äù and ‚Äúunmixed,‚Äù often used to describe fresh water.&lt;br/&gt;

Curators Sasha Stiles, Kalen Iwamoto, and Ana Mar√≠a Caballero (theVERSEverse) on FeralVerse:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúOur Feral File offering ‚Äî the first exhibition of verse on this platform ‚Äî is planted here as a seed for the poetry journal of the future, in which authorial imagination is unbounded, language and art exist in symbiosis, and every contributor is a vital force in a literary ecosystem in which connection to verse can lead to collection.&lt;br/&gt;
In celebration of both National Poetry Month and Earth Month, the texts published here as non-fungible Tezos tokens ‚Äì each a collaborative performance between writers and artists at the avant-garde of web3 poetry, including some of the planet‚Äôs most renowned voices ‚Äì reflect diverse perspectives, aesthetics, and approaches to the worlds around us and inside us, always in flux. Every work invites its reader to step into a reality augmented through the art of poetry, and to engage deeply with the untamed universe of possibilities for writers on (and off) the blockchain.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About theVERSEverse:&lt;br/&gt;
Launched in November 2021, theVERSEverse is a collective of critically acclaimed poets, writers, artists, and creative technologists working on and off the blockchain to unlock the literary potential of web3. Through hybrid events, community outreach, and partnerships, theVERSEverse is creating new opportunities for writers and reshaping the future of literature.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Selected Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSpring So Uneasy‚Äù by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram x Dina Chang. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Spring So Uneasy by Lillian-Yvonne Bertram x Dina Chang&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSpring So Uneasy‚Äù is a collaboration between poet Lillian-Yvonne Bertram and artist Dina Chang, in which Chang‚Äôs visuals provide a stunning photographic take on Bertram‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúThe Body Deformed by Tidal Forces.‚Äù The poem is a muscular lyrical meditation on the physics of tidal forces that simultaneously create solidity and changes of season through rotation and gravitational push/pull and threaten destruction when the same forces of these rotating celestial bodies are brought into too close a contact to sustain their individual integrities. The same phenomenon, Bertram suggests, literally and figuratively applies to earth-bound human bodies and the ways people too are bound to an ungodly planet spinning ferociously through the cosmos.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù by Seth Bockley x Helena Sarin. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù by Seth Bockley x Helena Sarin&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúNotes From A Hackberry Seed‚Äù is part of Seth Bockley‚Äôs Nature Speaks! series. This initiative, created through the poet‚Äôs position as director of creative engagement for Sovereign Nature Initiative, a web3 tech/theory/art collective, imagines giving human voice to nonhuman experiences, while recognizing the impossibility of fully translating those experiences. Helena Sarin‚Äôs visual rendering pays homage to the hackberry seed itself, the wood of the tree, its germination, pulsating, becoming, and the smile and energy with which the poet delivers the poem.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFuturum Febris‚Äù by Denise Duhamel x Diane Drubay. Image courtesy of theVERSEverse and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Futurum Febris by Denise Duhamel x Diane Drubay&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFuturum Febris,‚Äù fruit of the collaboration between the poet Denise Duhamel and visual artist Diane Drubay, takes us on a journey towards a distressing transcendence. The planet becomes a metaphor for the memories and thoughts of the narrator of ‚ÄúPilgrims,‚Äù Duhamel‚Äôs poem. Like a path that accompanies the text, going from the naivety of youth to the realization of a conflicting system, the exploration of the two planets invites us to travel towards a feverish future.&lt;br/&gt;
The visual piece is composed of an excerpt from Duhamel‚Äôs poem ‚ÄúPilgrims,‚Äù encircling the planets like a blue guiding thread. The two rotating 3D objects are covered with photographs of interference colors captured in the sky. One is calming and peaceful, creating a meditative state and a moment of harmony. The second is heated and alarming, causing a sense of fascination and panic at the same time. Drubay uses psycho-active colors and the feeling of total isolation to heighten the senses and embrace new ideas and perspectives.&lt;br/&gt;
This work plays with a descriptive narrative that takes the viewer/reader into a scene of changing emotions and states, calling for transformation by creating true impact.&lt;br/&gt;

with Yehwan Song and AES+F&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Giorgio Vitale on I Know:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThe ‚Äòtruth‚Äô considered in this exhibition is not a scientific or academic one, but rather an imaginative one. It is based on the slow unfolding that viewers experience when they sit with an artwork. In our current post-truth society, in which veracity and accuracy are sacrificed on the altar of hyperbole and misinformation, I Know invites artists to reexamine historical moments and to evoke images of the past in order to claim a place within it. These artists struggle with power, inequality, and discrimination, addressing debates about mass surveillance and the architecture of the web3. The works in the exhibition reflect on traditional modes of thinking, both inside of and outside of the arts, and in so doing make way for future possibilities.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to open LeeMullican.PCX, an exhibition of early computer works by Lee Mullican (1919-1998), a renowned painter and pioneer of digital art. An institutionally recognized painter with works in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others, Mullican started making digital art in 1986, at the age of 66. Curated by Anika Meier in collaboration with Cole Root, director of the Estate of Lee Mullican, this exhibition features 12 of Mullican‚Äôs digital works. Each artwork will be released as an edition of 20.&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition will be sold initially through 20 sets featuring an edition of all 12 artworks for $2,400. Sets will be sold for the first 24 hours; any remaining sets will then be broken up into individual editions¬†priced at $200 USD.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;

Collecting begins in one hour&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Anika Meier on LEEMULLICAN.PCX:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAs a pioneer of computer art, Lee Mullican has devoted his life to finding new ways to create images. He embraced new technologies and tools of the day. In the fall of¬†1986, Lee Mullican participated in UCLA‚Äôs Advanced Design Research Center‚Äôs Program for Technology in the Arts. The program allowed the then¬†66-year-old Mullican to start exploring the digital realm.&lt;br/&gt;
The exhibition LeeMullican.PCX presents 12 NFTs that demonstrate the artist‚Äôs relentless experimentation. Mullican is an institutionally recognized painter, he is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, among others. He skillfully used his knowledge of painterly techniques as a guide when he began working with computers and found common ground with his own style of painting and the chance made possible by the computer.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Lee Mullican was born in 1919 in Chickasha, Oklahoma and died in Los Angeles in 1998. Upon his graduation from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1942, Mullican was drafted into the army, serving four years as a topographical draftsman before moving to San Francisco in 1946.&lt;br/&gt;
After winning a prestigious Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959, he spent a year painting in Rome before returning to Los Angeles where he joined the UCLA Art Department in 1961, keeping his position for nearly 30 years. He divided the later part of his life between his homes in Los Angeles and Taos, traveling internationally and co-organizing exhibitions at UCLA. A retrospective spanning 50 years of the artist‚Äôs work was organized by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2005.&lt;br/&gt;
Mullican is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art, New York; the San Francisco Museum of Art; the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, among others.&lt;br/&gt;

View exhibition&lt;br/&gt;
Opening now, BLOOMCORE is an exhibition of a new series by Rick Silva, curated by Claire L. Evans.&lt;br/&gt;
Last year, Silva 3D-scanned hundreds of blooming plants throughout the Pacific Northwest, which he later grafted and pruned into a hyper-flora. In 30-second looping videos, eerie vegetal forms rotate and slice through a fog of atmospheric lights. The series, also titled BLOOMCORE, will be available in&lt;br/&gt;
a series of 55 unique artworks&lt;br/&gt;
, each priced at .25 ETH.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;
April 20, 2023&lt;br/&gt;
14:00 UTC+0 (7am Los Angeles, 11am S√£o Paulo, 3pm Berlin, 10pm Shanghai)&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting begins in one hour&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Claire L. Evans on BLOOMCORE:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúIn Silva‚Äôs BLOOMCORE, we encounter beings familiar, yet unknown, and unknowable. Lush rhododendrons, broad-leaved ferns, rare roses, denizens of deep forests: scanned in the spring of 2022, they are each presented in full bloom, at the height of their lives and thus also on the brink of death. As I write these words, most of the real-life plants Silva has volumetrically captured are almost certainly dead, but they‚Äôll remain preserved in perpetuity, on the blockchain, like museum specimens. To me this is profoundly gothic ‚Äî these blooms hanging outside of time in the radiant computational darkness, promising transcendence, concealing poison (Silva has even included a few poisonous pitcher plants in this collection, vegetal carnivores with alluring, vaselike forms). In this he summons the vast dreaming life of plants, their hidden, distributed way of knowing, their collective ancientness, and the slow, halting way they move across the world.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Rick Silva:&lt;br/&gt;
Rick Silva&lt;br/&gt;
is a Brazilian-American artist whose videos, websites, and installations explore virtuality, futurology, and speculative ecologies. His work has been exhibited at institutions including The Centre Pompidou, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, and The Whitney Museum of American Art. He has been featured in Artforum, Wired, and Rhizome‚Äôs NET ART Anthology. He lives in Eugene, Oregon where he is an Associate Professor at The University of Oregon.&lt;br/&gt;

In the spring and summer of 2022, artist Rick Silva 3D-scanned living plants throughout the Pacific Northwest ‚Äî in university greenhouses, coastal redwoods, the high desert, and the Cascade mountains. Following this field work, Silva grafted and pruned the digitized plants into an eternal hyper-flora that rotates and slices through a fog of atmospheric lights. His eerie vegetal forms hover at the edges of representation and abstraction, digital and organic, familiar and alien.&lt;br/&gt;

and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce the gallery‚Äôs new solo exhibition with artist group Whistlegraph, who have created ten ‚Äúwhistlegraphs‚Äù ‚Äî an original art form of scored musical drawings ‚Äî for the show. Each work will be auctioned to the highest bidder. (&lt;br/&gt;
Please see the Price List for complete detail&lt;br/&gt;
)&lt;br/&gt;
Writer Dorothy Rose Howard on Ten Whistlegraphs:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúIn Whistlegraph‚Äôs first solo show and exhibition, the artist group (Jeffrey Scudder, Camille Klein, Alex Freundlich) presents a new body of work featuring creative documentation of a selection of ‚Äúwhistlegraphs‚Äù ‚Äî memorizable lyrical poems that double as graphic scores, resulting in reproducible drawings.&lt;br/&gt;
Blending drawing with live performance documentation is Whistlegraph‚Äôs bread and butter; and it is this evasion of capture that also makes artifacts of their work so limitless. A set of files make up each of the ten whistlegraphs curated for Feral File ‚Äî a high definition video performance and graphic score made for the exhibition, in addition to a curated selection of TikToks of that same work, accessible through a custom interactive player. Each whistlegraph piece by the group has generated countless media artifacts and recordings in the form of social media posts (by Whistlegraph and fans alike), works on paper, and live recitals. Part of the beauty of this format is that once you grok it, you can make a whistlegraph yourself. Indeed many do write their own whistlegraphs‚Äîor interact with the group‚Äôs in the form of duets, mashups, and sing-alongs to the tune of digital folk.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
The show is accompanied by a text written by Dorothy Rose Howard.&lt;br/&gt;
About Whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
Whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
is composed of artists Jeffrey Scudder, Camille Klein, and Alex Freundlich, who draw, sing, and make videos together. The group formed during the 2020 pandemic in a cabin in Ashland, Oregon, which remains their creative base. Over the past few years, they have honed a distinctive style and practice that speaks to embodied cognition, art education, and experimental composition for live performance.&lt;br/&gt;
The group‚Äôs TikTok&lt;br/&gt;
@whistlegraph&lt;br/&gt;
is an important platform for their work, where they regularly engage with their 2.2 million current followers. Whistlegraph has also toured, performed, and led educational workshops at Kunstverein Hamburg (Germany), Rhizome, The Schneider Museum of Art (Ashland, OR), Oneroom Gallery (Providence, RI), Willem de Kooning Acadamie (Rotterdam, Netherlands), OCCII (Amsterdam, Netherlands), and the Banana School (Bananskole; Copenhagen, Denmark).&lt;br/&gt;

Lyrics:&lt;br/&gt;
Sitting curled up in myself&lt;br/&gt;
I think of a stone, just&lt;br/&gt;
waiting very patiently&lt;br/&gt;
for time to pass&lt;br/&gt;
For this exhibition, ‚ÄúLoner‚Äù is performed by its composer Camille Klein using a Kaweco Sport fountain pen on her Exacompta Bloc FAF Desk Pad.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMommy Wow‚Äù by Whistlegraph. Image courtesy of the artists and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Mommy Wow&lt;br/&gt;
Lyrics:&lt;br/&gt;
Here‚Äôs my zigzag&lt;br/&gt;
X my circle&lt;br/&gt;
PSHH! PEW!&lt;br/&gt;
I love mommy WOWWWW&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMommy Wow‚Äù was composed improvisationally by Whistlegraph, each member taking turns. For this exhibition, ‚ÄúMommy Wow‚Äù is performed in the evening by Whistlegraph outside of the Schneider Museum of Art with Hagoromo Luminous chalk on brick.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPeople Pleaser‚Äù by Whistlegraph. Image courtesy of the artists and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
People Pleaser&lt;br/&gt;
Lyrics:&lt;br/&gt;
When you‚Äôre told ‚ÄúAmazing! Incredible‚Äù best beware&lt;br/&gt;
Someone‚Äôs always saying, words you wanna hear&lt;br/&gt;
Products of low self-esteem,&lt;br/&gt;
peacefully prove their being mildly mean&lt;br/&gt;
to those around them&lt;br/&gt;
At the time of its composition by Jeffrey Scudder, ‚ÄúPeople Pleaser‚Äù was the longest whistlegraph in the groups‚Äô repertoire. It is rendered here by Whistlegraph in pencil on a Kamiterior Memoterior Colors Memo Pad.&lt;br/&gt;

Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
, a new solo exhibition by artist Auriea Harvey, curated by Gaia Bob√≤.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Gaia Bob√≤ on Gray Matter:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAuriea Harvey‚Äôs solo show&lt;br/&gt;
Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
presents a body of work emerging from an undefined and fluid ambient, where mud-like protoplasm is molded from a neutral background, solidifying into metaphysical apparitions. These data-based objects are marked by the memory of their material roots, similarly to archeological artifacts or witnesses. Indeed, the artist plays with the tools of archaeological research in the creation of her mythology and methodology. Auriea uses polygons in place of plaster, staging a non-literal and paradoxical practice of casting in a ping-ponging circularity from the sensual world to the digital one and back again. As in Pompeii‚Äôs casts, where the transition from the void left by an incinerated body is impressed into the durable matter of a plaster form, the artist seeks that continuum in the tension between ethereal and corporal, attempting to answer the question: what is this void made of?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Auriea Harvey:&lt;br/&gt;
Auriea Harvey is a sculptor living and working in Rome. Her practice encompasses virtual and tangible sculptures, drawings, and simulations that blend digital and handmade production including 3D printing, AR, and VR. She is primarily concerned with making the mythological world visible through form, interaction, and immersion. Her works are a synthesis of art historical reference and imagination. And she is engaged across time, media, and material to define what sculptural production means in the present moment. She is half of the artist duo which over time has been known as Entropy8Zuper!/Tale of Tales/Song of Songs, award-winning for their pioneering works in Internet art, video games, and mixed reality. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of institutions such as Buffalo AKG Art Museum, Walker Art Center, KADIST Collection,¬† RF.C Collection, and Rhizome‚Äôs Net Art Anthology. Her videogames and VR works have had international success, including exhibitions at the Tinguely Museum, Basel; the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum, London; the New Museum, New York; Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York; and ZKM, Karlsruhe.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúGray Matter,‚Äù the work that gives its name to the exhibition, is a statement on indefiniteness in the matter of thought: a triple portrait of a girl, a cyclops inside the cave of her mind with a candle-like flame burning at its eye, and a stylized emerging skull, all suspended in a gray infinity. The possibilities of interaction highlight the implicit potential in stretching, distorting, and playing with the materiality of the digital polygon, shifting perception and meaning.&lt;br/&gt;
AlleluiaAlleluia&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAlleluiaAlleluia‚Äù by Auriea Harvey. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚ÄúAlleluiaAlleluia,‚Äù a singing, polymorphic being swings in a zero-gravity nocturnal background, with two moon wedges positioned at the extremities of the piece, creating a mesmerizing atmosphere. Here, the self-portrait of the artist is combined with a scan of one wing of the Nike of Samothrace.&lt;br/&gt;
Messenger (fragment)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMessenger (fragment)‚Äù by Auriea Harvey. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
The perceptive experience of the work ‚ÄúMessenger (fragment)‚Äù is a sense of disorientation given by a glitch that occurred while scanning, which turned the bottom of the original sculpture into a cloud-like mass. Amplifying the impossibility of catching the whole ensemble of this sculpture all at once, in this digital piece, everything floats.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúThe ‚Äòtruth‚Äô considered in this exhibition is not a scientific or academic one, but rather an imaginative one. It is based on the slow unfolding that viewers experience when they sit with an artwork. In our current post-truth society, in which veracity and accuracy are sacrificed on the altar of hyperbole and misinformation, I Know invites artists to reexamine historical moments and to evoke images of the past in order to claim a place within it. These artists struggle with power, inequality, and discrimination, addressing debates about mass surveillance and the architecture of the web3. The works in the exhibition reflect on traditional modes of thinking, both inside of and outside of the arts, and in so doing make way for future possibilities.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúGeneric Mannequin Gets Flayed‚Äù by Zach Blas. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce Harbingers, an exhibition of five international artists assembling visions of transhumanist desires and technogenic anxieties.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Julia Kaganskiy on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFor millennia, speculations about how technoscientific innovations could transform living organisms ‚Äî by accident or design ‚Äî have animated our imaginaries of cyborgs, mutants, automatons, and replicants. As our environment becomes increasingly synthetic, polluted, and governed by planetary-scale computation, what kind of lifeforms will it support?&lt;br/&gt;
The group show Harbingers brings together a bestiary of the posthuman, assembling artistic visions of transhumanist desires and technogenic anxieties in an age of accelerated biosocial transformation. A menagerie of mutant creatures emerges from the recombinant crucible of computational manipulation, genetic engineering, viral mutation, biohacking, and cross-species contamination. Novel corporeal formations, at once familiar and strange, are produced through complex interrelations of nature, culture, and technology. Modernity becomes an agent of metamorphosis through the vectors of engineering, adaptation, and aberration. Each work in Harbingers offers a portal into a fabulated mirror world governed by its own mythology. The organisms assembled here include coded chimeras, genetically modified superhumans, bodies held captive by the algorithmic surround, and plants and animals that have evolved to metabolize plastics and toxic waste. All serve as sentinels of the transfigurative powers of technology and ecocide.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Generic Mannequin Gets Flayed&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Generic Mannequin Gets Flayed‚Äù is a corporate term for digital representations of bodies that are examined for risks and anomalies during airport body scans. Zach Blas appropriated this non-image in his installation ‚ÄúSANCTUM‚Äù (2018), a security-detention-center-meets-sex-dungeon environment that probes the dynamics of power, exposure, and desire inherent in surveillance and predictive policing through the lens of BDSM. Rendered silent and pliant through biometric capture, we see the mannequin bound, whipped, contained, and harvested for use in the creation of new weapons or sex toys. By invoking queer aesthetics and consentual power play, Blas leaves the question of complicity up for debate ‚Äî are the mannequins prisoners, sex slaves, worshippers, or experimental test subjects? The work‚Äôs ambiguity problematizes our symbiotic relationship with technology, examining the nature of personal agency, surveillance, and control in a world shaped by data mining and social engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
LES MUTANTS, #3&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLES MUTANTS, #3‚Äù by Shu Lea Cheang. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
This excerpt from UKI, Shu Lea Cheang‚Äôs forthcoming feature length sci-fi viral cinema, recounts the adventures of Reiko, a de-commissioned replicant. UKI is the sequel to Cheang‚Äôs iconic cyberpunk porn film I.K.U. (2000), which tells the story of biotech company Genom Corporation and its plan to harvest orgasm data to engineer and sell addictive orgasms. Discarded on the toxic waste dump E-trashville, Reiko encounters Les Mutants, creatures who have evolved over generations of e-trash remixing, toxic pollution, and viral infection. Les Mutants help Reiko reboot themself back to existence and transform into¬† the virus UKI, capable of infiltrating and sabotaging Genom Corp‚Äôs BioNet. In ‚ÄúLES MUTANTS, #1,‚Äù we see Reiko meeting the mutants‚Äô Mother Yeast, a body of ever expanding blobs, appearing like lumps of dough rising in all directions, and VARIUS, a black and white photograph of a 1900s boy whose face and body are pockmarked from smallpox infection.&lt;br/&gt;
Ojo! Don&amp;#x27;t Slip On the Ba-nano Peal&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúOjo! Don&amp;#x27;t Slip On the Ba-nano Peal‚Äù by *particle group*. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
This nanopoem was co-created by Amy Sara Carroll and Ricardo Dominguez of *particle group,* along with Maribel Montero (a nanolithography specialist). It was produced with a Raith50 E-beam Writer on silicon coupons at nano3 (UCSD). The writing field of the coupons was between 0.5 um (nanometers) to 5.0 um (for the sake of comparison, recall that a white blood cell is 7,000 nanometers in width). Two trajectories were at play in developing these nanolithographs ‚Äî the work focuses on the year 2012, the year that the Mayan Calendar ended/shifted. Representations of that time-change oscillated between the apocalyptic and the utopic, paralleling representations of ‚Äúnanocausts and nanotopias‚Äù tracked by the artists in their work. The year 2012 also marked the inauguration of the Tijuana Institute of Nanotechology (TIN), a speculative space for nano-scale research and art production where these signs first were ‚Äútaken for wonders.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce Simulation Sketchbook: Works in Process, a group exhibition curated by Jesse Damiani, which explores the various forms ‚Äúsketches‚Äù can take for artists working in new media and digital art. The exhibition will also feature Feral File‚Äôs first-ever physical pop-up at Vellum LA, and includes an LED billboard campaign in Downtown Los Angeles.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Jesse Damiani on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAn artist‚Äôs sketchbook is one of the most precious spaces for research and experimentation. In its ideal, the sketchbook is an intimate domain where artists capture ideas, test compositions, wrestle with subjects, and scribble marginalia, engaging in an ongoing inner dialogue that audiences don‚Äôt witness.&lt;br/&gt;
In analog forms, sketches are highly correlated with drawing on paper. Simulation Sketchbook: Works in Process poses a simple question: what does a sketch look like for an artist working in more experimental modes like digital art and time-based media? What is a sketch when it‚Äôs not a conventional drawing?&lt;br/&gt;
Whether they take the form of code, video, 3D models, immersive spaces, or multimodal explorations that don‚Äôt fit a neat categorization, these ‚Äúsketches‚Äù are no less integral to the development of the respective artist‚Äôs body of work. Because of the relative novelty among audiences, the technical and conceptual merits of these process-oriented arts can be difficult to grasp, leaving underlying poetics invisible or misinterpreted. Worse still is the assumption that this work is tantamount to button-pushing, that machines are the true authors‚Äîtrivializing the years spent developing a unique relationship with these materials‚Ä¶In this way, their sketches create a cascade of insight: regarding the art, the artist, and the new ways we might understand the relationship among ourselves and the tools of our daily lives.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot;Unveiling&amp;quot; by Behnaz Farahi. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúUnveiling‚Äù by Behnaz Farahi&lt;br/&gt;
Behnaz Farahi‚Äôs ‚ÄúUnveiling‚Äù addresses the representation of the female body through the veiling and unveiling of identity. It was created in direct response to the Mahsa Amini protests in Iran that began in September 2022 ‚Äî and supplanted the work that the artist had originally intended to contribute to the Simulation Sketchbook exhibition. Produced in less than two weeks, the work channels the artist‚Äôs raw processing of the feminist uprising taking place in her country of birth. By drawing herself into the final moments of ‚ÄúUnveiling,‚Äù Farahi reflects on her own connection to these issues in her personal narrative, and her current position as an expat working in the West, halfway across the world. As the artist writes, ‚ÄúWhy are there various laws controlling the bodies and lives of women? Where does the autonomy of the female body reside? While much feminist discourse is informed by a Western woman‚Äôs perspective, some of the largest-ever feminist protests are happening right now on the streets of Iran. With the Iranian uprising, ‚ÄòWoman, Life, Freedom‚Äô has become an expression of freedom and a political slogan to recognize the importance of the autonomy of the female body.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Note: all proceeds from the sale of ‚ÄòUnveiling‚Äô will be donated to charities supporting Women&amp;#x27;s Rights.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMachine Sees More Than It Says‚Äù by Mimi ·ªån·ª•·ªçha&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMachine Sees More Than It Says‚Äù by Mimi ·ªån·ª•·ªçha. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
As an artist interrogating the role of data collection in contemporary society, Mimi ·ªån·ª•·ªçha seeks to reveal what‚Äôs missing in our algorithmic lives. The presumption that technology is objective and indifferent is a boon to the powerful, often conveniently obscuring those power structures from view. ·ªån·ª•·ªçha‚Äôs work is an act of sensemaking, revealing these underlying dynamics and relationships in powerful clarity. ‚ÄúMachine Sees More Than It Says‚Äù consists of clips of footage gathered from archival videos made between the 1950s and the 1980s. Stitched together, they form a machine&amp;#x27;s imagining of itself and the courses of development that formed it, hinting at processes of resource extraction, transport, technical advancement, interfaces, and labor. In the words of the artist: ‚ÄúI was working on a completely different piece and kept stumbling across this footage from an array of different videos, all of which seemed to share an aesthetic feel and to hint at much deeper computational stories...as if the tools I was using were intervening to speak of themselves.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMachine Inspired Voice 00.1‚Äù by Reeps One&lt;br/&gt;

Artists working in generative formats have different ways of thinking about their tools. For some, it‚Äôs just that: tools. For others, it‚Äôs more akin to collaborating with a partner. Across much of his work at the cutting-edge of voice and technology, Harry Yeff frames a connected system of AI tools collectively as a sparring partner or workout buddy, a sort of composite machine rival through which to refine his (human) voice‚Äôs range and capability. In so doing, the artist uses AI to question the limit of his own voice, an opponent like duet and mentorship that pushes to new-voice and expression. Already among the best beatboxers in the world, Yeff‚Äôs lines of pursuit training with machines have pushed his capabilities into realms that truly begin to sound un-, non-, or post-human. ‚ÄúMachine Inspired Voice‚Äù is an ongoing research exploring multiple AI driven processes to develop new articulations, phraseologies and compositions in human voice expression. In ‚ÄúMachine Inspired Voice 00.1‚Äù Harry Yeff first interacts in real time with a synthetic vocalist using his own voice. Harry Yeff‚Äôs ability to develop complex machine-like vocal phrases is then ‚Äúlistened to‚Äù by the system and a reply is generated. This artwork offers a glimpse in process, and functions as a pre-release artist proof for a forthcoming series of over 300 AI and Human vocal phraseologies. The work is also presented as a spectrogram, which further reveals the range of audio frequencies visually.&lt;br/&gt;

Refik Anadol Studio on Unsupervised:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúUnsupervised processes 138,151 pieces of publicly available metadata from the vast collection of The Museum of Modern Art in the mind of a machine. Using StyleGAN2 ADA to capture the machine‚Äôs ‚Äòhallucinations‚Äô of modern art in a multi-dimensional space, Anadol trains a unique AI model with subsets of the archive of MoMA‚Äôs collection of artworks, creating embeddings in 1024 dimensions. The sorted image datasets are then clustered into thematic categories to better understand the semantic context of data. This expanding data universe not only represents the interpolation of data as synthesis, but also becomes a latent cosmos in which hallucinatory potential arises from a novel form of artistic creativity interpreting MoMA‚Äôs unparalleled collection of modern and contemporary art.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;

Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;
Watching Peter Burr, his collaborator Dave Tandem, and curator Julia Kaganskiy work together on&lt;br/&gt;
our final exhibition of the year, BOOM TOWN&lt;br/&gt;
, has been immensely rewarding. A couple of months ago, Peter told me the works were basically done, and to see him and Dave squeeze in extra details up to the final moments before the opening is a testament to how much they care about what‚Äôs being presented tomorrow.&lt;br/&gt;
I hope that you have the chance to join us for the opening, read Julia‚Äôs notes on the works, and participate in whichever way you feel comfortable, from viewing the artworks, purchasing a $75 edition, or perhaps even bidding on a complete set which includes 1:1s. Their idea of living artworks that are changing over time, and then comparing different works together over a long period of time, is really exciting.&lt;br/&gt;
Read&lt;br/&gt;
our announcement here&lt;br/&gt;
, and please join us on&lt;br/&gt;
Twitter Spaces&lt;br/&gt;
for a live conversation between artist and curator on December 14 at 18:30 UTC (1:30pm EST).&lt;br/&gt;

Perhaps you‚Äôve noticed our logo change (see¬†the top of this email) ‚Äî we have a series of design overhauls coming to the Feral File website and Autonomy app within Q1 2023.&lt;br/&gt;
Our secondary market has been disabled. After we migrate off the Bitmark chain (later this month) it will be easy to purchase Feral File artworks on existing secondary markets like Objkt and OpenSea. Part of the Feral File redesign will make it easy for you to find available secondary market editions.&lt;br/&gt;
We are on track to migrate all editions currently held by Feral File to Ethereum and Tezos blockchains in December.&lt;br/&gt;
Autonomy Digital Art Wallet users: we will migrate your editions currently held by Feral File to Tezos and Ethereum addresses linked in Autonomy for free. More information coming via separate email.&lt;br/&gt;
If you are in New York City this winter, don‚Äôt forget to visit&lt;br/&gt;
Refik Anadol‚Äôs installation at MoMA&lt;br/&gt;
, running until March 5th, 2023. Not only is the installation breathtaking (I got to visit myself a few weeks ago), but you‚Äôll be able to claim a free digital memento from your visit. A new memento is being launched on December 19th, and there will be different ones launching on unannounced dates afterwards, so don‚Äôt miss out!&lt;br/&gt;
We are restructuring¬†our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord community server&lt;br/&gt;
to encourage longer lasting discussions through forum threads. We hope it will now be easier for new and long-time members to engage and explore art together and have also instituted new rules to discourage bots and less serious users. See the completed changes within the next week.&lt;br/&gt;

Presenting BOOM TOWN, a New Solo Exhibition by Peter Burr, minted on Ethereum&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce BOOM TOWN, new media artist Peter Burr‚Äôs fictional neighborhood built and expanded on the blockchain. Each piece in BOOM TOWN, curated by Julia Kaganskiy, represents a unique, living artwork comprised of 1,000 images that will change over time, evolving as a kind of durational stop-motion animation over an undetermined period pegged to Ethereum‚Äôs block time‚Äîthat is, the length of time it takes to add another block to the blockchain.&lt;br/&gt;
Collectors receive the full set of images as part of their acquisition package and can browse or even create prints of the work‚Äôs past or future state, but they cannot make the work advance any faster or slower than block time. What will reach its end first, the work seems to be asking, the durational performance of BOOM TOWN? Or the technology it‚Äôs powered by? There‚Äôs only one way to find out.&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;
December 14, 2022&lt;br/&gt;
16:00 UTC+0 (11am New York, 1pm S√£o Paulo, 5pm Berlin, 12am Shanghai (Dec 15))&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting begins one hour later&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Julia Kaganskiy on BOOM TOWN:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLike most of his works, Peter Burr‚Äôs BOOM TOWN is a richly crafted narrative world that is deeply evocative while remaining mysterious and restrained. Displaying the artist‚Äôs gift for creating images and environments that hover on the boundary between abstraction and figuration, they invite the viewer to fill in the blanks with their own interpretation, suggesting a story that is barely legible yet unmistakably present. Inspired by the tools and aesthetics of video games, Burr‚Äôs compositions draw on generative dynamics and the complexity that emerges from simple, rule-based systems. Each of the eight works in BOOM TOWN follows a precise logic for generating the structure‚Äôs architecture, its ground and field, its shadows, planes, and colors. The resulting images are reminiscent of 8-bit video games and early computer graphics, as well as the flat diagrammatic quality of CAD architectural drawings.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Peter Burr:&lt;br/&gt;
Peter Burr is an artist from Brooklyn, New York. His practice often engages with tools of the video game industry in the form of immersive cinematic artworks. These pieces have been presented internationally by various institutions, including Documenta 14, Athens; MoMA PS1, New York; and The Barbican Centre, London.&lt;br/&gt;
Previously Burr worked under the alias Hooliganship and founded the video label Cartune Xprez through which he produced hundreds of live multimedia exhibitions and touring programs showcasing a multi-generational group of artists at the forefront of experimental animation. His practice has been recognized through grants and awards including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a Creative Capital Grant, and a Sundance New Frontier Fellowship.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Every one of the structures in BOOM TOWN represents a unique, living artwork comprised of 1,000 images that will change over time, evolving as a kind of durational stop-motion animation over an undetermined period pegged to Ethereum‚Äôs block time ‚Äî that is, the length of time it takes to add another block to the blockchain. Collectors receive the full set of images as part of their acquisition package and can browse or even create prints of the work‚Äôs past or future state, but they cannot make the work advance any faster or slower than block time.&lt;br/&gt;
Burr‚Äôs process blends traditional animation techniques with the affordances of generative algorithmic systems. Each work originates with ‚Äúintentionally unoptimized algorithms‚Äù developed by Burr‚Äôs collaborator, Dave Tandem, and follows a precise composition logic that dictates its form, ground and field, shadows, planes, colors, and weight. The software allows Burr to draw structures on a gravity-influenced canvas and to animate them changing over time. Burr is interested in highlighting the unique fingerprints of various software and in his practice often works across tech pipelines to weave these diverse fingerprints into a unique aesthetic, reveling in the compression and dithering that occurs through this approach. The final images are outputted into a custom framework built by Tandem that uses block time to advance their evolution.&lt;br/&gt;
APARTMENT BLOCK&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAPARTMENT BLOCK‚Äù by Peter Burr. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Like a chunk of houses glued together and cut into cubes, each with a standalone reality ‚Äî the apartment blocks aren‚Äôt meant to be good because the community enjoys the process of making them better.&lt;br/&gt;
FACTORY&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFACTORY‚Äù by Peter Burr. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
We‚Äôll sustain half the town with a small factory.¬† The taller the smokestack, the better we‚Äôll spread our invisible byproducts.&lt;br/&gt;
SHOPPING PLAZA&lt;br/&gt;

A good town needs a few places to go when you‚Äôre bored. None of them are here, but the food court has an arcade.&lt;br/&gt;
We look forward to seeing you&lt;br/&gt;
at the opening on Feral File&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúBecoming Illegible (Mirror Studies #1)‚Äù by Sarah Friend. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Primavera De Filippi, Stina Gustafsson, and Alex Estorick on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúOur exhibition Ecotone distills the creative outflows of the Glitch community of artists and technologists. This growing network considers digital and natural ecologies to be innately entangled, with cross-border collaboration a vital means of generating new social realities. Involving over 60 participants from around the world, Glitch is a spectrum of strategies and a model for a new creator ecology ‚Äî artistic, poetic, and human-machinic. For this show with Feral File, Glitch is represented by a number of leading artists, whose range of approaches reflects the plurality of the community.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Becoming Illegible (Mirror Studies #1)&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
Under the larger project, Becoming Illegible, which engages with both social media face filters and facial recognition, Sarah Friend‚Äôs ‚ÄúMirror Studies #1‚Äù is an interactive browser-based facefilter. Placing the facefilter form in dialogue with idealized ecological imagery, this work translates the questions of how we become legible to machine learning into the arena of how a landscape becomes legible to society. These images of landscapes and faces blend together ‚Äî at times familiar and recognizable, at others alien, Cthulhu-like, and abstract.&lt;br/&gt;
Interplanetary&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúInterplanetary‚Äù by Gene Kogan. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Gene Kogan‚Äôs video ‚ÄúInterplanetary‚Äù depicts an infinite progression of lush and exotic alien creatures residing symbiotically in organic vegetation. The technique by which Kogan made the video uses a generative neural network trained over millions of images and controlled through natural language. By prompting the model with unusual sentence constructions mixing Earthly ecology with sci-fi alien plots, strange interplanetary juxtapositions are generated.&lt;br/&gt;
Littor[alter]ms&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLittor[alter]ms‚Äù by Kalen Iwamoto. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Kalen Iwamoto‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittor[alter]ms‚Äù is at once a conceptual poem and a teaser for a forthcoming crypto-literary experiment. As a conceptual poem, it illustrates the (e)merging worlds of literature, NFTs, and crypto literature in a literal/literary translation of the ecotone. As a teaser, it unveils the main features and the underlying thrust of an upcoming experimental crypto-literary work whose seed was planted in a particularly fertile, ecotonal moment. The line of poetry in iambic pentameter set in relief at the meeting point of Shakespearean theater and NFTs reveals the crux of the experiment and our deep-seated ambivalence vis-√†-vis a relationship that is both wholesome and transgressive.&lt;br/&gt;
We look forward to seeing you&lt;br/&gt;
at the opening on Feral File&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce&lt;br/&gt;
Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
, a new solo exhibition by artist Auriea Harvey, curated by Gaia Bob√≤.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Gaia Bob√≤ on Gray Matter:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAuriea Harvey‚Äôs solo show&lt;br/&gt;
Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
presents a body of work emerging from an undefined and fluid ambient, where mud-like protoplasm is molded from a neutral background, solidifying into metaphysical apparitions. These data-based objects are marked by the memory of their material roots, similarly to archeological artifacts or witnesses. Indeed, the artist plays with the tools of archaeological research in the creation of her mythology and methodology. Auriea uses polygons in place of plaster, staging a non-literal and paradoxical practice of casting in a ping-ponging circularity from the sensual world to the digital one and back again. As in Pompeii‚Äôs casts, where the transition from the void left by an incinerated body is impressed into the durable matter of a plaster form, the artist seeks that continuum in the tension between ethereal and corporal, attempting to answer the question: what is this void made of?‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
About Auriea Harvey:&lt;br/&gt;
Auriea Harvey is a sculptor living and working in Rome. Her practice encompasses virtual and tangible sculptures, drawings, and simulations that blend digital and handmade production including 3D printing, AR, and VR. She is primarily concerned with making the mythological world visible through form, interaction, and immersion. Her works are a synthesis of art historical reference and imagination. And she is engaged across time, media, and material to define what sculptural production means in the present moment. She is half of the artist duo which over time has been known as Entropy8Zuper!/Tale of Tales/Song of Songs, award-winning for their pioneering works in Internet art, video games, and mixed reality. Her work can be found in the permanent collections of institutions such as Buffalo AKG Art Museum, Walker Art Center, KADIST Collection,¬† RF.C Collection, and Rhizome‚Äôs Net Art Anthology. Her videogames and VR works have had international success, including exhibitions at the Tinguely Museum, Basel; the Victoria &amp;amp; Albert Museum, London; the New Museum, New York; Brooklyn Academy of Music, New York; and ZKM, Karlsruhe.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúGray Matter,‚Äù the work that gives its name to the exhibition, is a statement on indefiniteness in the matter of thought: a triple portrait of a girl, a cyclops inside the cave of her mind with a candle-like flame burning at its eye, and a stylized emerging skull, all suspended in a gray infinity. The possibilities of interaction highlight the implicit potential in stretching, distorting, and playing with the materiality of the digital polygon, shifting perception and meaning.&lt;br/&gt;
AlleluiaAlleluia&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúAlleluiaAlleluia‚Äù by Auriea Harvey. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In ‚ÄúAlleluiaAlleluia,‚Äù a singing, polymorphic being swings in a zero-gravity nocturnal background, with two moon wedges positioned at the extremities of the piece, creating a mesmerizing atmosphere. Here, the self-portrait of the artist is combined with a scan of one wing of the Nike of Samothrace.&lt;br/&gt;
Messenger (fragment)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúMessenger (fragment)‚Äù by Auriea Harvey. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
The perceptive experience of the work ‚ÄúMessenger (fragment)‚Äù is a sense of disorientation given by a glitch that occurred while scanning, which turned the bottom of the original sculpture into a cloud-like mass. Amplifying the impossibility of catching the whole ensemble of this sculpture all at once, in this digital piece, everything floats.&lt;br/&gt;
We look forward to seeing you at the opening on Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúGeneric Mannequin Gets Flayed‚Äù by Zach Blas. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce Harbingers, an exhibition of five international artists assembling visions of transhumanist desires and technogenic anxieties.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Julia Kaganskiy on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúFor millennia, speculations about how technoscientific innovations could transform living organisms ‚Äî by accident or design ‚Äî have animated our imaginaries of cyborgs, mutants, automatons, and replicants. As our environment becomes increasingly synthetic, polluted, and governed by planetary-scale computation, what kind of lifeforms will it support?&lt;br/&gt;
The group show Harbingers brings together a bestiary of the posthuman, assembling artistic visions of transhumanist desires and technogenic anxieties in an age of accelerated biosocial transformation. A menagerie of mutant creatures emerges from the recombinant crucible of computational manipulation, genetic engineering, viral mutation, biohacking, and cross-species contamination. Novel corporeal formations, at once familiar and strange, are produced through complex interrelations of nature, culture, and technology. Modernity becomes an agent of metamorphosis through the vectors of engineering, adaptation, and aberration. Each work in Harbingers offers a portal into a fabulated mirror world governed by its own mythology. The organisms assembled here include coded chimeras, genetically modified superhumans, bodies held captive by the algorithmic surround, and plants and animals that have evolved to metabolize plastics and toxic waste. All serve as sentinels of the transfigurative powers of technology and ecocide.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Generic Mannequin Gets Flayed&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Generic Mannequin Gets Flayed‚Äù is a corporate term for digital representations of bodies that are examined for risks and anomalies during airport body scans. Zach Blas appropriated this non-image in his installation ‚ÄúSANCTUM‚Äù (2018), a security-detention-center-meets-sex-dungeon environment that probes the dynamics of power, exposure, and desire inherent in surveillance and predictive policing through the lens of BDSM. Rendered silent and pliant through biometric capture, we see the mannequin bound, whipped, contained, and harvested for use in the creation of new weapons or sex toys. By invoking queer aesthetics and consentual power play, Blas leaves the question of complicity up for debate ‚Äî are the mannequins prisoners, sex slaves, worshippers, or experimental test subjects? The work‚Äôs ambiguity problematizes our symbiotic relationship with technology, examining the nature of personal agency, surveillance, and control in a world shaped by data mining and social engineering.&lt;br/&gt;
LES MUTANTS, #3&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLES MUTANTS, #3‚Äù by Shu Lea Cheang. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
This excerpt from UKI, Shu Lea Cheang‚Äôs forthcoming feature length sci-fi viral cinema, recounts the adventures of Reiko, a de-commissioned replicant. UKI is the sequel to Cheang‚Äôs iconic cyberpunk porn film I.K.U. (2000), which tells the story of biotech company Genom Corporation and its plan to harvest orgasm data to engineer and sell addictive orgasms. Discarded on the toxic waste dump E-trashville, Reiko encounters Les Mutants, creatures who have evolved over generations of e-trash remixing, toxic pollution, and viral infection. Les Mutants help Reiko reboot themself back to existence and transform into¬† the virus UKI, capable of infiltrating and sabotaging Genom Corp‚Äôs BioNet. In ‚ÄúLES MUTANTS, #1,‚Äù we see Reiko meeting the mutants‚Äô Mother Yeast, a body of ever expanding blobs, appearing like lumps of dough rising in all directions, and VARIUS, a black and white photograph of a 1900s boy whose face and body are pockmarked from smallpox infection.&lt;br/&gt;
Ojo! Don&amp;#x27;t Slip On the Ba-nano Peal&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúOjo! Don&amp;#x27;t Slip On the Ba-nano Peal‚Äù by *particle group*. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
This nanopoem was co-created by Amy Sara Carroll and Ricardo Dominguez of *particle group,* along with Maribel Montero (a nanolithography specialist). It was produced with a Raith50 E-beam Writer on silicon coupons at nano3 (UCSD). The writing field of the coupons was between 0.5 um (nanometers) to 5.0 um (for the sake of comparison, recall that a white blood cell is 7,000 nanometers in width). Two trajectories were at play in developing these nanolithographs ‚Äî the work focuses on the year 2012, the year that the Mayan Calendar ended/shifted. Representations of that time-change oscillated between the apocalyptic and the utopic, paralleling representations of ‚Äúnanocausts and nanotopias‚Äù tracked by the artists in their work. The year 2012 also marked the inauguration of the Tijuana Institute of Nanotechology (TIN), a speculative space for nano-scale research and art production where these signs first were ‚Äútaken for wonders.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
We look forward to seeing you&lt;br/&gt;
at the opening on Feral File&lt;br/&gt;

Unsupervised: MoMA seen through the mind of a machine&lt;br/&gt;
Announcing a new solo exhibition with media artist Refik Anadol&lt;br/&gt;
Exhibition Opening:&lt;br/&gt;
November 18, 2021&lt;br/&gt;
9pm New York (11pm S√£o Paulo,  3am Berlin (Nov 19), 10am Shanghai (Nov 19))&lt;br/&gt;
Collecting begins one hour later&lt;br/&gt;
Three images from the ‚ÄúUnsupervised ‚Äî Machine Hallucinations ‚Äî MoMA ‚Äî Dreams‚Äù series by Refik Anadol Studio. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce the gallery‚Äôs ninth exhibition, featuring artworks by media artist Refik Anadol, who has trained a unique AI model with the metadata of The Museum of Modern Art‚Äôs unparalleled collection. The result is a series of software works, video works, and data paintings that capture the machine‚Äôs ‚Äúhallucinations‚Äù of modern and contemporary art at MoMA. Each work will be made available to collectors as NFTs.&lt;br/&gt;
Starting with the exhibition opening, new artworks will be revealed over three days. On November 18 at 10pm EST, one 1/1 software artwork and two 1/1 video artworks (shipped with accompanying hardware) will be auctioned to the highest three bidders. The next day at the same time, nine artworks in editions of 100 will be sold via nine group auctions. One day later, one video in an edition of 5,000 will be sold via set price. All auctions will take place over 24 hours.&lt;br/&gt;
Refik Anadol Studio on Unsupervised:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúUnsupervised processes 138,151 pieces of publicly available metadata from the vast collection of The Museum of Modern Art in the mind of a machine. Using StyleGAN2 ADA to capture the machine‚Äôs ‚Äòhallucinations‚Äô of modern art in a multi-dimensional space, Anadol trains a unique AI model with subsets of the archive of MoMA‚Äôs collection of artworks, creating embeddings in 1024 dimensions. The sorted image datasets are then clustered into thematic categories to better understand the semantic context of data. This expanding data universe not only represents the interpolation of data as synthesis, but also becomes a latent cosmos in which hallucinatory potential arises from a novel form of artistic creativity interpreting MoMA‚Äôs unparalleled collection of modern and contemporary art.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Spanning more than 200 years of art, from paintings to photography to cars to video games, the MoMA collection is an extraordinary dataset‚Äîwithin which works from artistic movements such as Surrealism, not unlike the works in Unsupervised, explored automatism, chance, and systems to generate unprecedented new art forms. The AI-based abstract images and shapes in Unsupervised are interpretations of the Museum‚Äôs wide-ranging collection, weighted toward the&lt;br/&gt;
special exhibition of new artworks on view at MoMA this fall.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Unsupervised ‚Äî Machine Hallucinations ‚Äî MoMA ‚Äî Dreams (Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúUnsupervised ‚Äî Machine Hallucinations ‚Äî MoMA ‚Äî Fluid Dreams‚Äù is a series of algorithmic AI data paintings showcasing Refik Anadol‚Äôs unique collaboration with machine learning at the intersection of technology and aesthetics. Each image in the series displays a cluster of chosen ‚Äúdream sequences,‚Äù as the artist goes through serendipitous allusions to modern visual expressions in the machine-mind.&lt;br/&gt;
Still image from ‚ÄúUnsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA‚Äù video by Refik Anadol Studio. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Unsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúUnsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA‚Äù is a global AI data painting that simulates a latent walk among the Museum‚Äôs digitized collection. The artist and his team used MoMA archives‚Äô metadata for the creation of UMAP Data Universe, which helped them construct seven dimensions of the artwork: x, y, z, r, g, b, and time. It combines Anadol‚Äôs vision of handling data within a universe that it creates for itself with his approach to data visualization‚Äôs latent space as a locus for never-ending, self-generating contemplation.&lt;br/&gt;
About Refik Anadol:&lt;br/&gt;
Refik Anadol (b. 1985, Istanbul, Turkey) is a media artist and pioneer in the aesthetics of machine intelligence, and the director of Refik Anadol Studio in Los Angeles. Since 2008, his works have explored the space among digital and physical entities by creating a symbiotic relationship between architecture, science, technology, and media arts. As an artist and a spatial thinker, he addresses the challenges, and the possibilities, that ubiquitous computing has imposed on humanity, and what it means to be a human in the age of AI. Anadol‚Äôs site-specific audio/visual performances have been featured at other iconic landmarks, museums, and festivals worldwide, such as Venice Architecture Biennale, Walt Disney Concert Hall, The Centre Pompidou, Florence Biennale, Hammer Museum, Art Basel, Dongdaemun Design Plaza, The Portland Building, Daejeon Museum of Art, Artechouse, International Digital Arts Biennial Montreal, Ars Electronica Festival, Arc De Triomf, Zollverein | SANAA‚Äôs School of Design Building, santralistanbul Contemporary Art Center, Istanbul Design Biennial, and Sydney City Biennale among many others. Anadol has partnered, and continues to work with, teams at Google, Nvidia, Microsoft, NASA JPL, Intel, IBM, Siemens, Epson, MIT, UCLA, Caltech, Harvard, Stanford University, and UCSF to apply the latest cutting-edge science, research, and technologies to his work.&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
is pleased to announce g√§mma, an exhibition of 33 unique artworks by generative artist p1xelfool, the gallery‚Äôs first exhibition minted on Tezos.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator kerry doran on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPixels are the smallest element that can be displayed on a digital screen, groupings of which comprise the billions of still and moving images in circulation today. Pixels are not dissimilar to gamma rays, the shortest yet most powerful of the rays in the electromagnetic spectrum. The difference between them would seem to do with perception: gamma rays are invisible, pixels are not. However, both require specifically designed environments to engender visibility, such as a scintillation detector or a computer with a digital display. Because of the relative ubiquity of the latter, the specificity ‚Äî and necessity ‚Äî of the computer environment may be easily overlooked, if not forgotten, when perceiving pixels. The seduction of the screen, with its pixel-based representations, obfuscates the fusion of software and hardware that illuminate content: code and cold cathode. As p1xelfool says, ‚ÄòCode = light.‚Äô&lt;br/&gt;
In g√§mma, p1xelfool fuses pixels with light, with code. With such an emphasis on these materials and their visual properties, the works may seem formalist. Indeed, the generative compositions are strikingly geometric and inorganic; for those familiar with p1xelfool‚Äôs larger body of work, those in g√§mma may come across as austere in comparison. Yet these works are deeper than their surface. p1xelfool‚Äôs approach is intent on reconnecting color and light with the computer environment to create engrossing sensorial experiences specific to it.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äú0 + 0 * 11‚Äù by p1xelfool. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
The 33 unique artworks presented in g√§mma are self-contained systems; each contains 3 seeds generated by the system, selected and arranged by the artist to comprise the final composition.&lt;br/&gt;
p1xelfool conceptualized these works with Processing, its visual and responsive coding environment feeling more expressive to the artist than analog painting. The works are executed with p5.js, which allowed p1xelfool to program pixels in the browser in real-time. ‚ÄúInstead of asking the program to draw lines, I asked it to manipulate the pixel arrays,‚Äù he describes. This underscores the conceptual motivation of the project, namely, the reappropriation of pixels (and light and code) rather than the visuals produced by them. When viewing the work, there is the option to hit the ‚ÄúP‚Äù key to pause the pattern; hitting the ‚ÄúS‚Äù key will save and download the frame.&lt;br/&gt;
p1xelfool‚Äôs generative animations are inspired by the logic of particle systems, yet they share no reference to the natural world. The visual environments of the works are specific only to the computer. In each work, two superimposed and interrelated systems simultaneously interact with one another. Their interrelated velocities determine the speed at which blocks of interplaying (and playful) color seem to descend to the bottom of the screen, cycling through new patterns and creating the illusion of endlessness. Colors and patterns are rhythmic and vibrational; visual pleasure is immense and infinite.&lt;br/&gt;

Feral File in Miami, New York City, and other exciting developments&lt;br/&gt;
As we head toward the end of the year, it‚Äôs been a good time to reflect upon the year. Despite the volatility in the world, I‚Äôm thankful for the continued support from the wonderful curators and artists in the Feral File community. They have invested in our vision of making digital art more accessible to experience and collect.&lt;br/&gt;
But before we close out the year, we still have two more exhibitions coming up.&lt;br/&gt;
Opening on November 21 is Peer to Peer, minted on Ethereum, with the Buffalo AKG Art Museum (formerly the Albright-Knox Art Gallery), curated by Dr. Tina Rivers Ryan. I could fill this entire newsletter with thoughts about the show, but I‚Äôll link to&lt;br/&gt;
our announcement email instead&lt;br/&gt;
. If you‚Äôre in Miami for Art Basel at the end of this¬†month, join&lt;br/&gt;
AKG and Feral File at the Peer to Peer Launch Party&lt;br/&gt;
. Attendees will receive an exclusive digital souvenir that‚Äôs connected to the heritage of the Museum, which is reopening early next year. I can‚Äôt share what it is, but it‚Äôs worth your time to get to the party. The exhibition is a fundraiser for the museum ‚Äî by collecting, you‚Äôre directly impacting the museum and its future support for the digital art we love.&lt;br/&gt;
Next week, we will also unveil a special gift for those who can‚Äôt join us in Miami and more details around collecting the exhibit.&lt;br/&gt;
Our second exhibition is a solo show with a Feral File alumnus curated by different Feral File alumnus, opening on December 8. We‚Äôll have more on that soon ‚Äî it‚Äôs worthy of its own email.&lt;br/&gt;
ICYMI, our work with MoMA, Refik Anadol, and AKG were discussed in this&lt;br/&gt;
recent New York Times article&lt;br/&gt;
. Last year, we were proud to present Anadol‚Äôs Unsupervised. This year, from November 19 (tomorrow) to March 05, 2023, Unsupervised will&lt;br/&gt;
be viewable at MoMA‚Äôs Gund Lobby&lt;br/&gt;
. As with the AKG party in Miami, visitors will receive an exclusive NFT gift from our&lt;br/&gt;
digital art wallet Autonomy&lt;br/&gt;
in this collaboration with MoMA.&lt;br/&gt;
Hint: you may want to visit the installation multiple times in the coming months‚Ä¶.I‚Äôll be there opening weekend to claim my gift.&lt;br/&gt;
Platform News&lt;br/&gt;
We have delayed migration off the Bitmark Blockchain&lt;br/&gt;
You may remember that&lt;br/&gt;
we‚Äôre in the process of moving&lt;br/&gt;
all of our Bitmark blockchain NFTs to either Ethereum or Tezos. This was originally scheduled for this time now, but we‚Äôve decided to delay things to the end of the year as we prioritize the work of executing the remainder of our exhibition schedule.&lt;br/&gt;
Native Web3 Support for Ethereum and Tezos Collectors&lt;br/&gt;
Starting with&lt;br/&gt;
Auriea Harvey‚Äôs solo exhibition, Gray Matter&lt;br/&gt;
, we now provide native web3 support for your wallet. This means when we run an Ethereum exhibition like Gray Matter, you can use your Ethereum wallet to collect just as you would on any other platform; the same is true for Tezos, which you can try out with exhibitions like&lt;br/&gt;
Ecotone&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Now that we have native support, you‚Äôll no longer need to deposit funds into our Wyre wallet. We‚Äôll be discontinuing that shortly ‚Äî please move forward with transferring any funds you have there into your web3 wallet.&lt;br/&gt;
Don&amp;#x27;t Forget&lt;br/&gt;
As it‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve written to everyone, I‚Äôd like to remind you of some of the excellent exhibitions we‚Äôve had recently that are still open for collecting:&lt;br/&gt;
Auriea Harvey: Gray Matter (Ethereum)&lt;br/&gt;
A solo show featuring interactive sculptures created from scans of physical sculptures, each of which was made from discarded material of previous works. The auction pieces also come with a physical sculpture. Just this week, Harvey was named in&lt;br/&gt;
The Artsy Vanguard 2022&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Simulation Sketchbook: Works in Process (Tezos)&lt;br/&gt;
A group show curated by Jesse Damiani that looks into the ‚Äúsketchbooks‚Äù of new media artists in order to explore our relationships with digital tools.&lt;br/&gt;
Harbingers (Tezos)&lt;br/&gt;
A group show curated by Julia Kaganskiy that assembles visions of transhumanist desires and technogenic anxieties. Every time the works are sold and traded on-chain, a random glitching process progressively manipulates and mutates them.&lt;br/&gt;
Ecotone (Tezos)&lt;br/&gt;
A group show with works from the Glitch community that explore the entanglements of digital and natural ecologies, curated by Primavera De Filippi, Stina Gustafsson, and Alex Estorick.&lt;br/&gt;
Doppelganger (Tezos)&lt;br/&gt;
A group show that crosses and fuses notions of digital and physical self, curated by Chris Coleman. First collectors receive a corresponding 3D print from Shapeways.&lt;br/&gt;
Wetware (Bitmark)&lt;br/&gt;
A group show of cyberfeminist works, curated by Mindy Seu, in support of Seu‚Äôs new book Cyberfeminism Index.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúBecoming Illegible (Mirror Studies #1)‚Äù by Sarah Friend. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Primavera De Filippi, Stina Gustafsson, and Alex Estorick on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúOur exhibition Ecotone distills the creative outflows of the Glitch community of artists and technologists. This growing network considers digital and natural ecologies to be innately entangled, with cross-border collaboration a vital means of generating new social realities. Involving over 60 participants from around the world, Glitch is a spectrum of strategies and a model for a new creator ecology ‚Äî artistic, poetic, and human-machinic. For this show with Feral File, Glitch is represented by a number of leading artists, whose range of approaches reflects the plurality of the community.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Becoming Illegible (Mirror Studies #1)&lt;br/&gt;
(pictured above)&lt;br/&gt;
Under the larger project, Becoming Illegible, which engages with both social media face filters and facial recognition, Sarah Friend‚Äôs ‚ÄúMirror Studies #1‚Äù is an interactive browser-based facefilter. Placing the facefilter form in dialogue with idealized ecological imagery, this work translates the questions of how we become legible to machine learning into the arena of how a landscape becomes legible to society. These images of landscapes and faces blend together ‚Äî at times familiar and recognizable, at others alien, Cthulhu-like, and abstract.&lt;br/&gt;
Interplanetary&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúInterplanetary‚Äù by Gene Kogan. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Gene Kogan‚Äôs video ‚ÄúInterplanetary‚Äù depicts an infinite progression of lush and exotic alien creatures residing symbiotically in organic vegetation. The technique by which Kogan made the video uses a generative neural network trained over millions of images and controlled through natural language. By prompting the model with unusual sentence constructions mixing Earthly ecology with sci-fi alien plots, strange interplanetary juxtapositions are generated.&lt;br/&gt;
Littor[alter]ms&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúLittor[alter]ms‚Äù by Kalen Iwamoto. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Kalen Iwamoto‚Äôs ‚ÄúLittor[alter]ms‚Äù is at once a conceptual poem and a teaser for a forthcoming crypto-literary experiment. As a conceptual poem, it illustrates the (e)merging worlds of literature, NFTs, and crypto literature in a literal/literary translation of the ecotone. As a teaser, it unveils the main features and the underlying thrust of an upcoming experimental crypto-literary work whose seed was planted in a particularly fertile, ecotonal moment. The line of poetry in iambic pentameter set in relief at the meeting point of Shakespearean theater and NFTs reveals the crux of the experiment and our deep-seated ambivalence vis-√†-vis a relationship that is both wholesome and transgressive.&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>Thank You for Your Support, WalletConnect Integration</description>
      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[https://feralfile.com&lt;br/&gt;
Happy holidays and thank you for supporting Feral File. Since our launch in March, it‚Äôs been a tremendous experience learning, building, and preparing Feral File for the future, and I deeply appreciate your support.&lt;br/&gt;
In case you‚Äôre looking for last-minute gifts this holiday season, we have&lt;br/&gt;
some fantastic artworks still available&lt;br/&gt;
at a fixed price.&lt;br/&gt;
My Year-End Thoughts&lt;br/&gt;
I‚Äôd like to copy something I shared internally with our team a couple of weeks ago:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúWe want to provide the best art collecting experience in the world. This is by allowing anyone, regardless of their wealth and past experience with art or crypto, to:&lt;br/&gt;
Experience and collect art&lt;br/&gt;
Buy using the methods they are accustomed to, and&lt;br/&gt;
Understand what they are buying through clear&lt;br/&gt;
Artist and Collector Rights.&lt;br/&gt;
When we fail, we need to be the best at providing support and using that experience to improve steps 1‚Äì3 so customers never need to contact us again.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
So How Are We Doing?&lt;br/&gt;
Now that you know my perspective on Feral File, I wanted to ask for your time on this two-question survey. I simply want to know, how are we doing, and how can we be better?&lt;br/&gt;
Please find it here.&lt;br/&gt;
Our next show is scheduled for late January ‚Äî until then, we‚Äôll be quietly working on making Feral File better for you and our artists. We have an amazing lineup already scheduled for 2022, and I cannot wait to unveil it.&lt;br/&gt;
Casey Reas‚Äô Year-End Thoughts&lt;br/&gt;
I‚Äôd also like to share Feral File co-creator Casey Reas‚Äô reflections on this year:&lt;br/&gt;
We now have a modular set of parts that can be used for different kinds of exhibitions, to be mixed and matched for each show.&lt;br/&gt;
In October, we launched our first solo exhibition with&lt;br/&gt;
(008) Jan St Werner‚Äôs Polyarrythmia&lt;br/&gt;
, our first audio-only show.&lt;br/&gt;
With&lt;br/&gt;
(009) Refik Anadol‚Äôs Unsupervised&lt;br/&gt;
, we launched the ability to have auctions for 1/1 artworks and what we call &amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;
group auctions&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot; for editions. We also experimented with an edition of 5,000 and it went well.&lt;br/&gt;
For&lt;br/&gt;
(010) -GRAPH&lt;br/&gt;
, we released our first software 1/1 exhibition, which is one piece of code that can generate many pre-minted 1/1 editions.&lt;br/&gt;
Early in 2022, we will be able to mint directly onto Tezos and Ethereum when that&amp;#x27;s the preference of the artists.&lt;br/&gt;
We released an&lt;br/&gt;
open call for curators&lt;br/&gt;
and all or most of the shows in the second half of 2022 will come from that, in order to bring in new artists and curators.&lt;br/&gt;
We&amp;#x27;re settling in to having two exhibitions each month, usually one group exhibition and one solo show.&lt;br/&gt;
The Ethereum &amp;quot;bridge&lt;br/&gt;
&amp;quot; has been launched for all past exhibitions‚Äîthis means burning on Bitmark and minting fresh on Ethereum with the provenance attached.&lt;br/&gt;
The FAQ has been updated to go over all of this in more depth:&lt;br/&gt;
https://feralfile.com/docs/faq.&lt;br/&gt;
New WalletConnect Support&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File now supports WalletConnect-compatible wallets such as MetaMask and Autonomy (that&amp;#x27;s from us! Find it on&lt;br/&gt;
Android&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
iOS&lt;br/&gt;
). Currently, you can use your wallet for decentralized login and 2FA. In the coming month, we will support deposits from your wallet and add other functionality. If you already have an account, access it on your&lt;br/&gt;
Account Page&lt;br/&gt;
. Otherwise, you can connect your wallet through a new account when you first sign in.&lt;br/&gt;
You can help us by sharing feedback and participating in user tests through our #features, #feedback, and #troubleshooting channels in the Platform section of our&lt;br/&gt;
Discord&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Redemption for Refik Anadol, MoMA, -GRAPH&lt;br/&gt;

Finally, the bridge for&lt;br/&gt;
For Your Eyes Only&lt;br/&gt;

Physical exhibition at Vellum LA:&lt;br/&gt;
February 16-March 5&lt;br/&gt;
Vellum LA, 7673 Melrose Ave&lt;br/&gt;
Los Angeles, CA 90046&lt;br/&gt;
Gallery hours: Thursday‚ÄìSunday 1PM‚Äì6PM PST&lt;br/&gt;
About the show:&lt;br/&gt;
Material Wonderland includes eight new NFT works minted on Ethereum, which will be available to purchase through Feral File. Also shown at Vellum LA will be works available as non-NFT digital files: two full-length video works exploring the game world as well as a massive video triptych of ‚ÄúMaterial World Knight,‚Äù presenting genome-edited human beings, human-machine composites with powered exoskeleton, and robots on an immersive 600 sq ft panoramic LED wall for Vellum LA‚Äôs opening reception.&lt;br/&gt;
The NFT works in the series are video loops rendered from within Lu Yang‚Äôs 2019 computer game, ‚ÄúThe Great Adventure of Material World,‚Äù first shown at the 2018 Shanghai Biennale. The game is initially experienced as a standard Japanese anime role-playing computer game, where players embody the Material World Knight as they complete quests and battle enemies together with other characters drawn from the artist‚Äôs earlier works, while growing in power and abilities. However, over the course of ten stages players undergo multiple identity transformations as they move beyond tropes of popular manga culture to explore the control of identity liberated from the rigid confines of nationality, gender, and sexuality.&lt;br/&gt;
Material Wonderland is set in dialogue with the LACMA‚Äôs Coded: Art Enters the Computer Age, 1952‚Äì1982, open from February 12th, which explores how the rise of computer technology, together with its emergence in popular consciousness, impacted the making of art in the age of the mainframe.&lt;br/&gt;
About Lu Yang&lt;br/&gt;
Lu Yang (b.1984 China, based in Tokyo, Japan) creates fantastical, often painful and shocking images which represent a blend of religion, philosophy, neuroscience, psychology and modern technology, as well as references to real life forms and structures of natural and religious origin. Lu Yang‚Äôs output spans gaming engines, 3D-animated films, video game installations, holograms, motion capture performances, virtual reality and software manipulation. The artist also collaborates with acclaimed scientists, psychologists, performers, designers, experimental composers, music producers, robotics companies and pop stars.&lt;br/&gt;
Yang‚Äôs work has been shown in major exhibitions at the UCCA, Centre Pompidou, ICA London, Mus√©e d‚Äôart Contemporain Lyon, Momentum Berlin, MAXXI National Museum of XXI Arts, and the Asia Society NY Art Triennial. He has also participated in numerous Biennales such as: Shanghai Biennale, (2018 and 2012), Athens Biennale (2018), Liverpool Biennial (2016), Montreal International Digital Art Biennial (2016), and Fukuoka Asian Art Triennale (2014). Lu Yang was selected for the Chinese Pavilion at the 2015 Venice Biennale and has featured new work in The Milk of Dreams exhibition at the 2022 Venice Biennale.&lt;br/&gt;

In the words of Adam Berninger: ‚Äú&lt;br/&gt;
Truth&lt;br/&gt;
is a show about finding a common underlying philosophy behind the works of seven very different generative artists working in abstraction. Here, each artist has created a new series that explores the building blocks of our universe at different scales, ultimately accentuating the relative sameness in what they represent.‚Äù¬† Artists include&lt;br/&gt;

You can now watch in real time as the prismatic robot enacts its ‚Äúice-generation‚Äù algorithm to create unique archetypes‚Äîsuch as masks, solar crosses, mandalas, stars, trees, snowflakes, and mycelium.&lt;br/&gt;
Every time the robot completes an archetype, the performance is dropped into the Feral File gallery as a tokenized 3D WebGL art piece documenting the creation of that unique solar moment.&lt;br/&gt;

Unsupervised ‚Äî Data Universe ‚Äî MoMA Migration&lt;br/&gt;
Hi everyone,&lt;br/&gt;
If you&amp;#x27;re looking to migrate your Refik Feral File NFTs to be able to participate in the burn, do not use the Autonomy free migration feature. While we&amp;#x27;d love for you to try Autonomy, the migrations won&amp;#x27;t be fast because we&amp;#x27;re optimizing for gas fees.&lt;br/&gt;
Thus, if you need the migrations done right away, please do a manual migration (1 at a time, you pay the fee). You can find this feature in the individual artwork page under your collection on Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
If you have requested an Autonomy migration, and need to cancel it, you can do so by clicking ‚ÄúCancel Web3 Move‚Äù at the top of Feral File‚Äôs home page on the top of the header.&lt;br/&gt;

A bit about +GRAPH&lt;br/&gt;
Two years ago, we opened&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄìGRAPH&lt;br/&gt;
, what would become an iconic exhibition for Feral File‚Äôs first year of existence. Now two years later,¬†+GRAPH continues in the tradition of exhibiting generative art drawn with plotters. Like the original, this new exhibition explores the deep historical connection between coding and drawing and brings together artists who engage with both. Five artists ‚Äî&lt;br/&gt;
Licia He&lt;br/&gt;
,&lt;br/&gt;
Aleksandra Jovaniƒá&lt;br/&gt;
,&lt;br/&gt;
James Merrill&lt;br/&gt;
,&lt;br/&gt;
Iskra Velitchkova&lt;br/&gt;
, and&lt;br/&gt;
Julien Gachadoat&lt;br/&gt;
‚Äî from ‚ÄìGRAPH join us again, with the very exciting addition of&lt;br/&gt;
Joanie Lemercier&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Each of the six artists in +GRAPH created generative software that is capable of making limitless new drawings, and has transformed 30 of these variations into physical works using a plotter machine. Every plotter drawing in this exhibition is a 1/1 artwork, meaning only one will ever be created. Along with each of these unique drawings, there are millions of other compositions that are embedded in the original code.&lt;br/&gt;
As part of our Exhibition Notes series, we are excited to share extended talks with the artists exhibiting in +GRAPH.&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúI.K.U.: Expand, an interface‚Äù by Shu Lea Cheang. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File&lt;br/&gt;
and&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark&lt;br/&gt;
are pleased to announce WETWARE, featuring Cornelia Sollfrank, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley, Linda Dement, Mary Maggic, Morehshin Allahyari, Prema Murthy, Shu Lea Cheang, Skawennati, and VNS Matrix, on the occasion of the upcoming publication CYBERFEMINISM INDEX.&lt;br/&gt;
Curator Mindy Seu on the exhibition:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúCoined in the early 1990s by the British cultural theorist Sadie Plant and artist collective VNS Matrix, the word cyberfeminism takes on its prefix ‚Äúcyber‚Äù ‚Äî recast from Cybernetics, a 1948 book by Norbert Wiener, and ‚Äúcyberspace,‚Äù from William Gibson‚Äôs 1984 novel Neuromancer ‚Äî as a provocation. This cyberspace of the 1980s was stocked with and characterized by cyberbabes and fembots, a techno-utopian imaginary of the male gaze. ‚ÄúCyberfeminism‚Äù prompted women and marginalized communities to imagine how a reoriented cyberspace could look. By now, three decades after its origination, cyberfeminism has shifted from a loose artistic movement exploring the emancipatory potential of cyberspace towards a collective drive to provide software, hardware, and wetware education and to get marginalized groups online. Today, with questions of technology more and more clearly ‚Äòbound together with questions of ecology and the economy,‚Äô as noted by Cornelia Sollfrank, the term is self-reflexive: technology is not only the subject of cyberfeminism, but its means of transmission. It‚Äôs all about feedback.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
WETWARE showcases nine artists to celebrate and support their work and the upcoming publication CYBERFEMINISM INDEX, slated for an October 2022 release with Inventory Press.&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of the Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
I.K.U.: Expand, an interface&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúThis is not love. This is sex.‚Äù Shu Lea Cheang‚Äôs feature-length cyberpunk sci-fi porn film I.K.U. (2000) tells the story of the internet porn enterprise Genom Corporation that dispatches I.K.U. coders to collect ‚Äúorgasm data,‚Äù developing the ability to sell profitable and addictive on-demand orgasms. ‚ÄúI.K.U. is a phenomenon that wants to refuse definition ‚Ä¶. As much trans-genre as it is trans-gender, I.K.U. also wants to merge video and film into a fresh digital universe large-scale enough to overwhelm the viewer.‚Äù In conjunction with the film release, Cheang created an interactive website called ‚ÄúExpand, an interface‚Äù (2001) with stills from I.K.U. Using horizontally expanding and glitching panels to reveal I.K.U. coders such as Reiko or Tokyo Rose, ‚ÄúExpand, an interface‚Äù challenges the censorship in cinema versus online. The website is no longer online, and this screen recording was recaptured by Shu Lea Cheang in 2022, alongside stills from the film as well as the interface.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúContested Zone‚Äù by VNS Matrix. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Contested Zone&lt;br/&gt;
Contested Zone (1993) by VNS Matrix is a digital image created for the 1993 project ALL NEW GEN. Part artwork, part computer game, ALL NEW GEN was released as a CD-ROM and distributed widely in Australia and internationally. The CD-ROM was also exhibited as the centerpiece of the ALL NEW GEN installation with lighboxes, soundworks, photography, sculptural elements, video and a Bonding Booth for pleasurable distraction.&lt;br/&gt;
Join the cyber warrior All New Gen and the renegade tribes of the Contested Zone to sabotage the databanks of Big Daddy Mainframe and launch the New World Disorder. Enter the Contested Zone, a labyrinth of bizarre and mysterious cyberworlds, where the future is now, and Big Daddy Mainframe is in control. Manipulating the minds of the online masses through his nasty neural nets, BDM is expanding his transplanetary empire and nothing will get in his way. But resistance is not futile! All New Gen, an omnipresent being (computer virus, bio simsystem, intelligent mist) is on a mission with the renegade tribes to sabotage the info core of the insidious data dictator. All New Gen is assisted on her mission by the DNA Sluts, a band of renegade Sheroes; along with ferals, data deviants, cortex crones and code warriors.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúSocial Capital Fights‚Äù by Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Social Capital Fights&lt;br/&gt;
In a time of cancel culture and click bait, Danielle Brathwaite-Shirley wants us to be able to argue again. This type of conflict is a necessary part of communication, to be able to voice our opinions, disagree, and still have empathy for one another. ‚ÄúSocial Capital Fights‚Äù (2022) is a provocation for raucous disagreements and against the erasure of similitude. The music video speaks of trans people who are in support of having difficult conversations in our increasingly public, online environments, rather than narrowing our social bubbles even more. ‚ÄúDemon babies‚Äù populate the music video as mannequin heads covered in a balaclava made of hair, hair tools, and hair accessories, as a way to grapple with Brathwaite-Shirley‚Äôs own hair loss; the demons look after her. Brathwaite-Shirley created this work specifically for this exhibition.&lt;br/&gt;

      <description>We‚Äôre upgrading to a true native Web3 Experience</description>
      <ns0:encoded>&lt;![CDATA[*|MC_PREVIEW_TEXT|*&lt;br/&gt;
Hi,&lt;br/&gt;
Now that Ethereum has successfully migrated to proof of stake, Feral File will complete two major changes by the end of October:&lt;br/&gt;
Native Web3 Wallet Experience:&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File will work like any other Web3 experience. Moving forward, the curator and artist for each exhibition will select the chain they want to mint on. You will be able to sign into Feral File with your preferred Tezos or Ethereum wallet. You can then pay crypto directly (no more deposits or conversion to USDC) and hold the artwork with your own wallet. And yes, credit card payments will still be supported.&lt;br/&gt;
Feral File will have two types of accounts, one in which Feral File holds your assets as it does today (custodial), and one in which you hold them (native web3 / self-custody) in your own wallet.&lt;br/&gt;
Our recommendation is to hold assets in your own wallet.&lt;br/&gt;
Crypto wallets are usually chain-specific; if you would like to collect across all of Feral File‚Äôs exhibitions without needing multiple accounts and wallets, we would love for you to try&lt;br/&gt;
our Autonomy digital art wallet&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Bitmark Chain NFT Migration:&lt;br/&gt;
We will bridge all Feral File artworks that are still on the Bitmark chain to either Tezos or Ethereum, depending on artist preference. The Bitmark chain will become an archive-only registry.&lt;br/&gt;
As I send this email, we have launched native web3 support for Tezos wallets. Ethereum support will follow in a few weeks. In October, we will replace Feral File‚Äôs secondary market with third party secondary market listings (objkt, OpenSea). Your listings on Feral File will no longer function.&lt;br/&gt;
How to transfer your Feral File artworks and account balance to your web3 wallet&lt;br/&gt;
You can migrate any edition minted on Bitmark to your Ethereum wallet now. If you do nothing by November 15, your Bitmark NFTs will be automatically migrated to Tezos or Ethereum depending on the preference of the artist who created that artwork. These NFTs will be under the control of your existing Fearl File (custody) account. You can then transfer them from Feral File into your own crypto wallet.&lt;br/&gt;
We view blockchain preference as a personal decision. Both Ethereum and Tezos are great public blockchains with vibrant communities and their own unique values. Our promise is to abstract away the technical details to provide a single, consistent experience for your artwork regardless of the underlying chain.&lt;br/&gt;
If you have any questions, feel free to reply to me here or on Discord in&lt;br/&gt;
our Troubleshooting channel&lt;br/&gt;
.&lt;br/&gt;
Thanks for your continued support,&lt;br/&gt;

Curator Casey Reas on P1√ó3L:&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúA P1√ó3L is the atomic unit of digital and generative art. It can‚Äôt be quantified. A P1√ó3L is vibrant and alive. Artists choreograph P1√ó3Ls and P1√ó3Ls possess artists. P1√ó3Ls are ideas about image-making that transcend the technology they flow through‚Ä¶. This remarkable group of artists has each pushed the boundaries of the fields of digital and generative art in their own ways. As a counterpoint to the stream of technology being developed to make itself invisible, these artists foreground the materiality of their medium.&lt;br/&gt;
Online spaces for digital and generative art are at the highest energy I‚Äôve seen in over two decades, and things have shifted even since we started organizing this exhibition in June. I‚Äôm thrilled to present this new work from this group of artists who committed to digital and generative art over a decade ago and remain vibrant creators. Their past work has stood the tests of time and their current work pushes forward.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Preview of Select Artworks:&lt;br/&gt;
Nicolas Sassoon ‚Äî 4 ORBS&lt;br/&gt;
(Pictured Above)&lt;br/&gt;
Nicolas Sassoon‚Äôs ‚Äú4 ORBS‚Äù is a new digital moir√© animation that is part of a series of animated optical patterns created from geometric shapes and motifs. Its geometry is informed by optical and kinetic art of the 1960s and 1970s, created by artists like Jes√∫s Rafael Soto and Victor Vasarely. The series is also influenced by science fiction book covers from the collection ‚ÄúAilleurs et Demain‚Äù (Elsewhere and Tomorrow) published in France in 1969. ‚Äú4 ORBS‚Äù is released along with its companion work ‚Äú3 ORBS.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Raquel Meyers ‚Äî Picnic 001&lt;br/&gt;

In describing her ‚ÄúPicnic 001,‚Äù Raquel Meyers writes, ‚ÄúWe keep going backwards no matter what,‚Äù and she calls it a ‚Äúdecoration for high-resolution screens. A roadside picnic for civil care.‚Äù Raquel lives in the Basque Country in Spain, and within this artwork she brings together the industrial heritage of that area, the new dress code for women in Afghanistan, and the mediation of the smartphone. Raquel created the frames of this GIF animation with techniques she developed over years of engaging with vintage computer technologies, specifically Teletext systems and Commodore 64 computers.&lt;br/&gt;
p1xelfool ‚Äî k.a9&lt;br/&gt;
k.a9 by p1xelfool. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
In the long tradition of kinetic art and experimental film and video, p1xelfool‚Äôs works contain a world within themselves. We might be looking at the inside of an atom or the birth of a simulated universe ‚Äî the work leaves room for broad interpretation. There‚Äôs enough within them to trigger recognition and association, but the lack of resolution creates space for mystery. In ‚Äúk.a9‚Äù specifically, we experience two objects rotating around one another in an endless dance of forces in balance. This software is one of a pair of p1xelfool‚Äôs first ever generative, live-code releases. We‚Äôre thrilled to feature this new direction on Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
Francoise Gamma ‚Äî Hatless&lt;br/&gt;

‚ÄúHatless lose away off why half led have near bed. At engage simple father of period others except. My giving do summer of though narrow marked at. Spring formal no county yet waited. My whether cheered at regular it of promise blushes perhaps. Uncommonly simplicity interested is be compliment projecting my inhabiting. Gentleman he september in oh excellent.‚Äù&lt;br/&gt;
Cut-up language with erratic meaning goes hand-in-hand with the animations of Francoise Gamma. ‚ÄúHatless‚Äù was created through a process of experimentation where the body, movement, transformation, and dimension were simultaneously pushed into new directions within the same sequence of drawings. The result is a GIF loop that contrasts flatness and 3D, is glitched and smooth, is anatomically proportional and distorted. According to Francoise, this GIF animation was made specifically to circulate on the web and to exist within that milieu.&lt;br/&gt;
ertdfgcvb ‚Äî POST 1&lt;br/&gt;
POST 1 by ertdfgcvb. Image courtesy of the artist and Feral File.&lt;br/&gt;
‚ÄúPOST 1‚Äù is a grid of fixed-width alphanumeric and graphic symbols. These elements create a soft architecture that supports evolving geometric compositions that transition from one configuration to another. The focus is on the choreography of the image and how it changes through time. He uses an older pixel font, but as he puts it, the ‚Äúpieces are cold,‚Äù without a nostalgic warmth for retro-computing aesthetics.&lt;br/&gt;
